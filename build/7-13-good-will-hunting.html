<h2 id="1-the-good-will-hunting-problem">1. The Good Will Hunting problem</h2>
<figure><img src="/resources/good-will-hunting/good-will-hunting.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>“Good Will Hunting” is a 1997 film that won two Oscars and made Matt Damon and
Ben Affleck famous, as they starred in and wrote the film. It tells the story of
a janitor called Will Hunting, who keeps the floors clean and the lecture
heatres tidy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of world’s
best universities. However, unknown to the professors, Will is a mathematical
genius, and the film tells the story of his battle to come to terms with his
remarkable talent for numbers and his struggle to understand his relationship
with his best friend, his girlfriend and himself. Along the way, he is helped by
a psychologist played by Robin Williams, who appears in the film’s poster next
to Matt Damon.</p>
<p>Take a look at this clip, which starts with a maths professor confronting his
students, because someone has solved one of his problems and he doesn’t know
who – of course, we know who solved the problem.</p>
<p></p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" id="youtubeplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ta3sClUQmfM?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Although the problem that Will is working on is said to be incredibly difficult,
that is just a bit of Hollywood exaggeration, because this is a problem that
you – <strong>yes, you!</strong> – might be able to solve.</p>
<p>This is the problem: <strong>draw all homeomorphically irreducible trees of size
<em>n</em> = 10.</strong></p>
<p>First, don’t panic! Don’t be scared by the scary words. It is not as terrifying
as it sounds. Let me translate what it means into terms that you will understand.</p>
<p>In maths, trees are dots connected by lines, but in this case the lines cannot
form loops. Also, the question requires that a tree is not allowed to have a dot
connected to only two lines, because the dot could be removed and it would not
look very different.</p>
<p>We can show the rules as they apply to drawing trees with 5 dots.</p>
<p>Tree (a) is not allowed, because the red dot has only two lines, one going in
and one going out. That is just waste of a dot.</p>
<p>Tree (b) is not allowed because it has a loop. Remember, no loops.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-13-good-will-hunting/graph-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>In fact, the only tree that you can make with 5 dots is this one. No loops. No
dots with just two lines.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-13-good-will-hunting/graph-2.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>The only other thing you need to know about trees is that all of the 5-dot trees
below are considered to be the same. They are copycat trees because they can be
bent, stretched, twisted and flipped, so that they look the 5-dot tree above.
That is why we say there is only one 5-dot tree. One way to see that they are
all the same tree is to note that each tree consists of <strong>one dot with four
lines</strong> and <strong>four dots with only one line</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-13-good-will-hunting/graph-3.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Now it’s time to see if you have understood the maths of trees.</p>

</ul>


<div class="solution"><p>The correct answers are (b) and (c). The other trees do not qualify because (e)
has dots that are connected to exactly two other lines, and both (a) and (d)
have loops.</p></div></div><p>Hopefully, you are now getting the idea, but before we get to the full Good Will
Hunting problem, here are three warm ups.</p>
<p>You will need to get a piece of paper and start drawing some trees. The key
things are: don’t create forbidden trees, and don’t create copycat trees. Copycat
trees are sometimes hard to spot, so really twist and turn your trees to check
that one of them cannot be transformed into another.</p>

film implies. However, you have just been learning some maths that you would
not normally do until A level. So, well done. Don’t worry if you did not
understand everything about trees, but if you did get most of the answers right
then double well done.</p>
<h2 id="2-nasas-massive-blackboard-photograph">2. NASA’s massive blackboard photograph</h2>
<p>This week I can across two terrific photographs of NASA mathematicians writing
down some mathematics on their giant blackboards. The boards were used for
calculating rocket orbits and for getting astronauts to the Moon, and I suppose
they had to be large so that everyone in the department could watch, learn and
contribute.</p>

<p>Although all the mathematicians in these photos are men, there were lots of
female mathematicians working at NASA at this time. In fact, there was a film
all about these NASA women that was released in 2017, and which
received three Oscar nominations. Here is a poster for the film with the title
removed, and a still from the movie.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>The correct answer is (b). No reason that you should have known this, but you
could have googled it.</p></div></div><h2 id="3-the-councillor-problem">3. The Councillor Problem</h2>
<p>A local councillor is knocking on doors. He is carrying out a survey, because
he is wondering whether the community needs a new school.</p>
<p>When he knocks on one door, a lady answers and he asks her two questions: “How
many children do you have, and what are the ages of your children?”</p>
<p>The lady is a mathematician, so she decides to make the councillor do some
maths to work out the answers. She tells him that she has 3 children, but she
does not give their ages. Instead, she gives him a clue.</p>
<p><strong>CLUE 1: The product of their ages is 36.</strong></p>
<p>The councillor is confused. The children could be 2, 3 and 6 (because 2 x 3 x 6
= 36), but there are lots of other possibilities. The mathematical mum decides
to help him with another clue.</p>
<p><strong>CLUE 2: The ages add up to the number of my house.</strong></p>
<p>The councillor is happy for a moment, but then realises that he still can't tell
what their ages are so he asks for a final clue, and the mum agrees.</p>
<p><strong>CLUE 3: The lady then explains that her eldest child plays chess.</strong></p>
<p>Straightaway he knows their ages, says thank you and moves on to the next house
(hoping that the next parent will be more straightforward).</p>
<div class="problem input" id="p_3" data-marks="3">
      <div class="marks">3 marks</div><p><strong>3.1</strong> How old is the oldest child?</p>
<p>If you can work out the answer then go for it. If you are a bit stuck, then …
keep trying. I promise that you are smart enough to work out the correct ages of
the children, and therefore the age of the oldest child. If you are still stuck
after a few minutes of effort, then there are some hints below. There are 3
marks for this question, but you will lose half a mark for each clue that you need.</p>

      <div class="hint" v-show="c.answers['hint-1']">
      <div class="hint-marks">–0.5 mark</div><p>Start by creating a list of all the possible ages for the three children,
bearing in mind that we know that the ages multiply to give 36. If you are
doing this on your own then try to do it in an order so that you can make sure
that you have not missed out any possibilities. Luckily, I have given you a
table (with some gaps) that show that there are 8 possibilities. Copy the
table onto a piece of paper and fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Once you have identified all the possibilities, go back and look at clues 2
and 3 that the mathematical mum gave and see if you can work out the ages of
the children, and therefore the age of the oldest child.</p>
<p>If you are still stuck... then try harder... but you could also try hint 2.</p>
