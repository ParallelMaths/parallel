<p><strong>Noun</strong>: Parallelogram
<strong>Pronunciation</strong>: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/</p>
<ol>
<li>a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>There are only 2 more Parallelograms this year, as we will be starting our summer break at half-term. If you score highly enough in the last 4 Parallelograms (#12, #13, this one &amp; #15) by June 1, <strong>then you will receive a Parallel certificate</strong>. An average of more than 40% in these four Parallelograms wins a bronze certificate, then 60% or more wins silver and 80% or more wins gold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.</li>
<li>But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.</li>
<li>Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.</li>
<li>Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.</li>
<li>Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-mathematics-of-aging">1.	The mathematics of aging</h2>
<p>An aunt is 40 years old and she has a niece who is 10 years old – aunty is 4 times older.</p>
<p>In 5 years from now, the aunt will be 45 and the niece will be 15 – aunty is 3 times older.</p>
<p>15 years later, the aunt will be 60 and the niece will be 30 – aunty is only 2 times older.</p>

<div class="problem radio" id="p_2_1" data-marks="2">
      <div class="marks">2 marks</div><p><strong>2.1.</strong> Usain runs twice as fast as his mum. His mum runs five times as fast as his pet tortoise, Turbo. They all set off together for a run down the same straight path. When Usain has run 100 m, how far apart are his mum and Turbo the tortoise?</p>
<ul class="col-5 choices">
<li><div class="choice" data-value="a" v-on:click="c.setAnswer('p_2_1', 'a')" v-bind:class="{active: c.answers.p_2_1 == 'a'}">5 m</div></li>

</ul>


<div class="solution"><p>When Usain has run 100 m his mum has run half this distance, that is, 50 m and Turbo has run one-fifth of his mum’s distance, that is, 10 m. So the distance between his mum and Turbo is
(50 − 10) m = 40 m.</p></div></div><h2 id="3-double-negatives">3. Double negatives</h2>
<p>A double negative is something like: “I didn't not go to the park today.” This can be rewritten as: “I did not not go to the park today.”</p>
<p>This actually means: “I did go to the park today.”  The “not not” cancel each other out. You can think about it mathematically, as (not = -1) and (not not = −1 × −1 = +1).</p>
<p>Sometimes a double negative works differently, such as in the phrase: “I didn't go nowhere today.” It has two NOTs in it, first in (didn’t = did not) and second in (nowhere = not somewhere)... so according to the previous rule this suggests that “I didn’t go nowhere” means “I went somewhere”. However, we all know that if someone says this then they didn’t go anywhere. If we think about it mathematically it is a negative added to a negative instead of a negative multiplied by a negative, i.e., (−1 + −1 = −2).</p>
<p>In the second example, the double negative means really, really negative, not positive.</p>
<p>My friend Len Fisher, an Australian physicist who lives in Bristol, once pointed out an example of something very unusual, namely a double positive.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>In the early 1950′s, the esteemed Oxford philosopher J. L. Austin came to Columbia to present a paper about the structural analysis of language. He pointed out that, in English, although a double negative implies a positive meaning (i.e. “I’m not unlike my father…”), there is no language in which a double positive implies a negative. “Yeah, yeah,” scoffed Morgenbesser from the back of the auditorium.</strong></p>

<h2 id="5-adas-puzzle">5. Ada’s puzzle</h2>
<p>Before I forget, make sure you check out the Additional Stuff section, where you will find out about the Ada Lovelace comic book.</p>
<p>When historians went through archive of Ada’s personal papers in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, they discovered a piece of paper with baffling doodles. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that Ada was tackling a problem in what we now call graph theory. Here is a related graph theory problem.</p>
<div class="problem radio" id="p_5_1" data-marks="2">
      <div class="marks">2 marks</div><p><img src="/resources/8-14-ada-lovelace/5-ada-puzzle.png" alt="" image="" align="right">
<strong>5.1.</strong> The drawing below was made with a single line. In other words, the pencil was placed on the paper, it never left the paper until the drawing was complete, and at no time did the pencil go back over any line that had previously been drawn. Where might the drawing have begun?</p>
<ul class="choices">
<li><div class="choice" data-value="a" v-on:click="c.setAnswer('p_5_1', 'a')" v-bind:class="{active: c.answers.p_5_1 == 'a'}">A</div></li>

</ul>


<div class="solution"><p>By trial and error, you should have worked out that the only place you can start from is C in the bottom right corner (or the unlabelled bottom left corner). Why? In fact, you have to start at one of the bottom corners and end at the other bottom corner. If you count the number of lines connected to each of the intersections, the total is always even apart from the two bottom right and left corners, which have 3 lines. This odd number of connections turns out to be crucial, and we’ll return to it in the next Parallelogram.</p></div></div><h2 id="6-junior-maths-challenge">6. Junior Maths Challenge</h2>
