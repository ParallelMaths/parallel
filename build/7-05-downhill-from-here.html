<h2 id="1-winter-olympics-puzzle-a">1. Winter Olympics Puzzle (A)</h2>
<p>Every four years, the world’s leading winter athletes – the skiers, skaters,
sledders and snowboarders – gather to compete for medals in the Winter Olympic
Games. In 2018, the games have been taking place in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Of course, among the drama, bravery and triumph, there is plenty of room for
maths! So, while you’re cheering on your favourites, don’t miss the chance to
tackle these Winter Olympics maths puzzles.</p>
<p>The Jamaican bobsled team was one of the most famous feel-good stories of the
1988 Games in Calgary. Jamaica’s Caribbean climate is not the most helpful for
bobsledding, but the team borrowed equipment and asked for help. While the
four-man bob team was unplaced after crashing in qualifying, the two-man team
finished a creditable 30th out of 41. The movie <em>Cool Runnings</em> is – very
loosely – based on their experience.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-05-downhill-from-here/1-bobsled.jpg" alt="" image="" align="center"></figure>
<p>In the bobsled (or bobsleigh), teams of two or four pack into a streamlined
sled and slide down a twisting, icy course with steep, banked corners as fast
as they possibly can – often as fast as 75mph. It gets its name from early
competitors who realised they could go faster by bobbing back and forth inside
the sled!</p>
<p>The 2010 Winter Olympics at Whistler, Canada, took place on a track 1,450
metres long. Each team had four runs at the course, and the winners were the
team with the smallest total time.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to use a calculator for these puzzles!</strong></p>

<p>The most famous ski jumper in history is not exactly famous for being good.
Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards, self-funded and short-sighted, famously finished in
last place in both the 70m and 90m events at Calgary, Canada in 1988, scoring
fewer than half as many points as his nearest competitor. However, these
scores are still the British records for ski-jumping! In 2016, a film of his
exploits, <em>Eddie The Eagle</em>, was released.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-05-downhill-from-here/2-ski-jump.jpg" alt="" image="" align="center"></figure>
<p>In the ski jump, competitors ski down a huge ramp, reaching speeds of up to
60mph before jumping as far down the hill as they possibly can.</p>
<p>Each jump is awarded points based on two factors: the distance jumped, and the
jumper’s style.</p>
<p>Here is the recipe (we've simplified it a bit for this puzzle!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Take 60 metres away from the distance jumped (this could be a negative
number!)</li>
<li>Double the result</li>
<li>Add on the style score.</li>
</ul>
<p>A group of judges also awards up to 60 points for style – how well the jumper
flies and lands.</p>
<p>For example, to work out the score for a ski jumper who jumped 95 metres with
enough grace to pick up 40 style points, you would calculate:</p>
<p class="text-center">95 – 60 =  35<br>
35 ×  2 =  70<br>
70 + 40 = 110<br>
</p>
<p>...so the jump would be worth 110 points.</p>
<p>Similarly, a jumper who manages 80 metres with 25 style points would score 65
points altogether.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>Let the area of the shaded face be ⲭcm². Then each of the visible unshaded
faces has area 4ⲭcm². Hence the total surface area of the cuboid in cm² is
ⲭ + ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ = 18ⲭ (because there are two ends, each of area ⲭ, and four sides, each of area 4ⲭ).</p><p>So 18ⲭ = 72. Therefore ⲭ = 4, and the area of one of the visible unshaded faces,
in cm² is 4ⲭ =  16.</p></div></div><h2 id="5-the-affine-cipher">5. The affine cipher</h2>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we discussed how you can encode a message by
turning each letter into a number according to the alphabet-number pairings
below, and either (1) adding a fixed value to each letter-number or (2)
multiplying each letter-number by a fixed value. The result is then turned
back into a letter.</p>

<p>The affine cipher uses both multiplication and addition to encipher a letter,
word or whole message. For example, let’s multiply each letter in the message
(L<sub>M</sub>) by 5 and then add 2 to get each letter in the code (L<sub>C</sub>). We could say:</p>
<p class="text-center">L<sub>C</sub> = (5 × L<sub>M</sub>) + 2</p>
<p>Let’s apply this affine cipher to the word CAB. If we turn this into numbers,
we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.</p>
<p>If we multiply by 5 and add 2, we obtain 12 ¦ 2 ¦ 7.</p>
<p><strong>If we translate back into letters, the code is MCH.</strong></p>
<p>Now, let’s encipher the same word, but this time we will change the affine
cipher so that we multiply by 9 and add 11:</p>
<p class="text-center">L<sub>C</sub> = (9 × L<sub>M</sub>) + 11</p>
<p>Again we will start with the word CAB. If we turn this into numbers, we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.</p>
<p>If we multiply by 9 and add 11, we obtain 29 ¦ 11 ¦ 20.</p>
<p>Remember, we cannot have numbers bigger than 25, so we subtract 26 from any
problematic numbers, so that 29 becomes 3. So, the new letter sequence is 3 ¦
11 ¦ 20.</p>
<p><strong>If we translate back into letters, the code is DLU.</strong></p>
<p>If you are confused (perhaps you missed some of the earlier Parallelograms),
then take a look at <a href="Chegg.com" target="_blank">this video from Chris at Chegg.com</a>. The explanation is
fairly slow and lengthy, but it should clear up any confusion.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://cryptii.com/affine-cipher" target="_blank">a website that implements the affine cipher</a>. You can change
the multiplication number (labelled “Slope / A”) and the added number
(labelled “Intercept / B”). You can check some of your answers above or just
play around with encrypting messages. If you adjust the multiplication number,
you will notice that some numbers are not allowed – can you remember why this
is the case?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CASghTzNhc&amp;t=0m25s&amp;rel=0" target="_blank">another clip featuring the Amazing James
Randi</a>,
in which he tests someone who claims he can move objects with the power of his
mind. I think this clip is terrific because it shows how a bit of clever
thinking can create a test that demonstrates that this psychic has no special
powers. First you will see the fake psychic and then you will see Randi’s clever test. (I should add that no psychic has ever convinced the scientific community that they have special superhuman powers, so the assumption is that all psychics are fake.)</p>
