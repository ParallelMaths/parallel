<p><strong>Noun</strong>: Parallelogram
<strong>Pronunciation</strong>: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/</p>
<p><strong>Origin</strong>: late 16th century: from French parallélogramme, via late Latin from Greek parallēlogrammon, from parallēlos ‘alongside another’ + grammē ‘line’.</p>
<ol>
<li>a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.</li>
<li>a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
young mathematicians.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Welcome to this week's Parallelogram designed for Year 7 students, a
collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make
your neurons more squiggly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.</li>
<li>But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.</li>
<li>Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.</li>
<li>Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.</li>
<li>Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct
answer).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.</p>
<h2 id="1-junior-maths-challenge">1. Junior Maths Challenge</h2>
<!--- 2011 (2e) --->
<p>The Junior Maths Challenge is a national maths competition run by the UK Maths
Trust, and many of you might be entering this year. Ask your teacher, and he or
she will know whether you or your class will be entering. Each week, the
Parallelograms will contain one or two Challenge questions from the tests given
in previous years.</p>
<p>What is the remainder when the following numbers are divided by 9?</p>
<div class="problem input" id="p_1_1" data-marks="0.5">
      <div class="marks">0.5 marks</div><p><strong>1.1</strong> 152</p>
<p class="text-center"><input type="text" data-solution="8" data-value="p_1_1_0" v-on:change="c.setInput" v-model.lazy="c.answers.p_1_1_0" v-bind:class="{correct: c.checkInput(c.answers.p_1_1_0, '8')}"><span class="input-solution">Correct Solution: 8</span></p>



<div class="solution"><p>You should know that there is an easy test to see if a number is divisible
by 9. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, then the actual number is
also divisible by 9. Anything left over is the remainder.</p><p>152 is not divisible by 9, because 1 + 5 + 2 = 8, which obviously is not divisible
by 9. But this does tell us the remainder: 8.</p></div></div><div class="problem input" id="p_1_2" data-marks="0.5">
      <div class="marks">0.5 marks</div><p><strong>1.2</strong> 9,876,543,210</p>
<p class="text-center"><input type="text" data-solution="0" data-value="p_1_2_0" v-on:change="c.setInput" v-model.lazy="c.answers.p_1_2_0" v-bind:class="{correct: c.checkInput(c.answers.p_1_2_0, '0')}"><span class="input-solution">Correct Solution: 0</span></p>



<div class="solution"><p>9,876,543,210 is divisible by 9, because the digits add up to 45 which is
divisible by 9 (as well as knowing our times tables, we know 45 is divisible by
9 because 4 + 5 = 9).</p><p>You might have noticed that the digits in this number can also be paired, so
that each pair adds up to 9 (9 + 0, 8 + 1, 7 + 2, 6 + 3, 5 + 4), so all the digits must
add up to a multiple of 9.</p></div></div><div class="problem input" id="p_1_3" data-marks="1">
      <div class="marks">1 mark</div><p><strong>1.3</strong> 689,689</p>
<p class="text-center"><input type="text" data-solution="1" data-value="p_1_3_0" v-on:change="c.setInput" v-model.lazy="c.answers.p_1_3_0" v-bind:class="{correct: c.checkInput(c.answers.p_1_3_0, '1')}"><span class="input-solution">Correct Solution: 1</span></p>
</div><div class="problem input" id="p_1_4" data-marks="1">
      <div class="marks">1 mark</div><p><strong>1.4</strong> 555...555, which is 5 written out 2011 times in a row</p>
<p class="text-center"><input type="text" data-solution="2" data-value="p_1_4_0" v-on:change="c.setInput" v-model.lazy="c.answers.p_1_4_0" v-bind:class="{correct: c.checkInput(c.answers.p_1_4_0, '2')}"><span class="input-solution">Correct Solution: 2</span></p>


<div class="solution"><p>It is easy to add up the digits of 5 written out 2,011 times. It is just 5 x
2,011, or 10,055. Is that divisible by 9? Well, 1 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 5 = 11, so it is not
divisible by 9, and because 1 + 1 = 2, the remainder is 2.</p></div></div><h2 id="2-junior-maths-challenge">2. Junior Maths Challenge</h2>

<p>A train display shows letters by lighting cells in a grid, such as the letter
‘o’ shown. A letter is made bold by also lighting any unlit cell immediately to
the right of one in the normal letter.</p>
<div class="problem radio" id="p_2_1" data-marks="2">
      <div class="marks">2 marks</div><p><strong>2.1</strong> How many cells are lit in a bold ‘o’?</p>

</ul>





<div class="solution"><figure><img src="/resources/7-03-crosses-crosses/3-lightssolution.png" alt="" image="" align="right"></figure><p>The only thing to do here is to draw (or imagine) the figure corresponding to a
bold ‘o’, and to count the number of cells that are lit.</p><p>We see that the extra cells that need to be lit are the 10 cells shown in
black.</p><p>This makes 24 lit cells altogether.</p></div></div><h2 id="3-tic-tac-toe-or-noughts-and-crosses">3. Tic-tac-toe or noughts and crosses</h2>
<p>Mathematicians love playing games. In fact, there is a whole area of maths
known as Game Theory, which looks at everything from Monopoly to poker to chess
to football to warfare. You can apply maths to work out the best strategy for
winning.</p>
<p>In this Parallelogram, we have a video that looks at one of the simplest games:
noughts and crosses (or tic-tac-toe as it is known in some countries).
If you have half a brain, then you will know how to play noughts and crosses
and never lose (and sometimes win if you are playing against a 5-year-old). So,
this video looks at what happens if you change the rules. Professor Thane Plambeck
shows you how to become world champion at a version that only involves crosses.</p>
<p>Watch it carefully, pause it if necessary and think about it carefully. If you
understand how to win at the crosses only version of noughts and crosses, then
challenge your friends and family and see if you are truly unbeatable. Also,
remember to answer the question below.</p>

<div class="problem radio" id="p_4_1" data-marks="1">
      <div class="marks">1 mark</div><p><strong>4.1</strong> You’re running a race and pass the person in 2nd place. What place are

</ul>



<div class="solution"><p>Most people say First, because it feels as if you are now better than the
Second place person. But think about it for a moment and you will realise you are
Second for all sorts of reasons:</p><ul>
<li>If you overtook Second then you must have been in Third place, and moving up
one place means you are now Second.</li>
<li>You are now better than the Second place person, that person has slipped back
to Third place, so you are now the Second place person.</li>
<li>The only way to be First is to overtake the First place person, and you have
not done that yet, so you can’t be in First place.</li>
</ul></div></div><h2 id="5-decoding-caesar">5. Decoding Caesar</h2>
<p>Last week, we discovered how you can encode a message by turning it into a
number according to the alphabet-number list below, adding a number and then
turning the new number back into a letter.</p>

<p>So, if we want to encode the word CAT by (+2), then CAT is 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 19, so adding
2 transforms it into  4 ¦ 2 ¦ 21, which means CAT is encoded as ECV.</p>
<p>If we encode by (+10), then because CAT is 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 19, so adding 10 transforms it
into 12 ¦ 10 ¦ 29. The number 29 is tricky, because no letter is associated with 29,
so last week we talked about modulo arithmetic. In this case, modulo (26), if we
have a number that is outside our range of 0 to 25, then we add or subtract 26 again
and again until we are within the range of 0 to 25. This means that 12 ¦ 10 ¦ 29
becomes 12 ¦ 10 ¦ 3, which means CAT is encoded as MKD.</p>
<p>If you need to revise this, then go back and look at the
<a href="/7-02-marie-curie" target="_blank">previous Paralellogram</a>.</p>
<p>But what about <strong>decoding</strong>? You can decode a word by subtracting, instead of
adding.</p>
<p>A word has been encoded by adding 15 and the result is RDL. To decode it, turn
the encoded word into numbers, which is 17 ¦ 3 ¦ 11, then subtract 15, which turns
it into 2 ¦ -12 ¦ -4. The problem is that neither -12 nor -4 are in our
range of 0-25, so we add 26 so that -12 becomes +14, and -4 becomes +22. So now
we have 2 ¦ 14 ¦ 22, which is the word COW.</p>
<p>Now try these decoding challenges.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>The early questions (5.1 to 5.3) are easy, and some of you might have been
able to jump straight to the answer BAT, without going through each
mathematical step. However, it is important to understand the step-by-step
method in order to prepare for the harder questions.</p><p>With 5.4 and 5.5, the tricky step is dealing with the correct answer to 5.4,
which is 5 ¦ 11 ¦ -2. The allowable range is 0 to 25, so we have to add 26
to -2 to get 24. So we are now dealing with 5 ¦ 11 ¦ 24, which is FLY.</p><p>Step 5.6 requires you to subtract 2,622, which leaves you with three large
negative numbers, namely:</p><p class="text-center">-2,621 ¦ -2,612 ¦ -2,603</p><p>You could try adding 26 again and again, but the short cut is to spot that these numbers are close to -2,600, which is -100 × 26. So we can jump to trying to deal with -21 ¦ -12 ¦ -3. Add 26 to these and we get 5 ¦ 14 ¦ 23, which is FOX.</p></div></div><h2 id="6-amazing-james-randi-and-his-rope-trick">6. Amazing James Randi and his rope trick</h2>
<p><img src="/resources/7-03-crosses-crosses/3-james-randi.jpg" alt="">
One of my heroes is James Randi, who is often known as the Amazing Randi. In
the last few decades he has become a champion of rationality and a debunker of
nonsense, but he started off in show business as a magician and an escapologist.</p>
<p>Well after becoming a pensioner, Randi was performing escapology. See if you
can work out how he escapes from the ropes in the video below.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING – do not try escapology or anything else that Randi does. This stuff is
DANGEROUS.</strong></p>

<p>Well done on completing this week’s Parallelogram. Check your email or return
to the website on Friday for the next one.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday. This
is really important. What you got right is much less important than what you
got wrong, because an incorrect answer provides you with an opportunity to
learn something new.</p>
<p>First... remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, so that we can mark your
answers.</p>
<p>Also, once you have hit the SUBMIT button there will an extra bit of optional
Parallelogram.</p>
<p>Cheerio,
Simon.</p>

<p>The noughts and crosses video in this week’s Parallelogram reminded me of a
couple of things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Today’s best computer programmes can beat humans at the most complex games,
such as Chess or Go, but this video from 1949 shows that has been a long and
hard journey to get to where we are now. The black and white video shows an
early computer mastering how to play noughts and crosses.
<a href="https://www.britishpathe.com/video/noughts-and-crosses-machine" target="_blank">https://www.britishpathe.com/video/noughts-and-crosses-machine</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hot topic today is machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).
This article – which is fairly complicated – shows how you could build a
computer out of matchboxes, which could teach itself to win at noughts and
crosses.
