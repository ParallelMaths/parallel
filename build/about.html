<p>The Parallel Project aims to encourage young mathematicians to explore the world
of mathematics by providing a weekly set of challenges that are designed to
stretch brains and broaden horizons. The goal is to help good mathematicians
become strong, and to help strong mathematicians become brilliant.</p>
<p>Following a pilot in the summer of 2017, the project was relaunched in early 2018, creating weekly challenges (known as Parallelograms) for students in Y7 and Y8. In time, we hope to have materials that are accessible to all secondary students, right through to GCSE, and for children still in primary school.</p>
<p>Anyone can sign up, so please spread the work among your friends, family and
classmates. However, the Parallel Project was originally devised as an add-on
for students participating in the Top-Top Set Maths Project. The Top-Top Sets have been established in four schools, so far, to help enthusiastic young
mathematician to achieve their potential. You can find out more about the project below.</p>
<p>Both the Top-Top Set Project and the Parallel Project are run by author Simon
Singh and <a href="#good-thinking">Good Thinking</a>, a charity that
promotes science and challenges pseudoscience. The website has been designed and built by Philipp Legner (creator of the brilliant <a href="https://mathigon.org/">Mathigon</a>), with ongoing support from Michael Marshall, and with input from Richard Lissaman (creator of the superb
<a href="http://mei.org.uk/sumaze">Sumaze!</a>) and <a href="http://london.bahfest.com/">BAHFest</a>
hero Ed Thorne.</p>
<h2 id="top-top-set">Top-Top Set</h2>
<p>The Top-Top Set Maths Project is running a pilot in two secondary schools in
Newham and two schools in SE England. The aim of the project is to maximise the potential of numerate and ambitious students (starting in Year 7), by nurturing and challenging them until they leave school for higher education. Students involved in the project should be aiming beyond A* at A level, so that they are able to earn places on STEM degree courses at the best universities, and are then able to thrive as undergraduates.</p>
<p>If the pilot is successful, the aim is to grow the project rapidly. Our
aspiration is that the TTS is available in all schools, thereby significantly
increasing the number of high-performing STEM students, particularly from groups
who have been previously underrepresented.</p>
<p>The Newham part of the project is being co-ordinated by Matthew Squire at Newham
Collegiate Sixth Form Centre.</p>
<h2 id="good-thinking">Good Thinking</h2>
<p><a href="http://goodthinkingsociety.org/">Good Thinking</a> is a charity founded by Simon
Singh. In short, the charity promotes science and challenges pseudoscience.</p>
