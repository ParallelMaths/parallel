<h2 id="1-hidden-figures-another-maths-movie">1. Hidden Figures – another maths movie</h2>
<figure><img src="/resources/sumaze/hidden-figures-poster.png" alt="" width="170"></figure>
<p>Last week we looked at the film “Good Will Hunting” and explored one of the
mathematical problems that appears in it. I also posed a question about another
film: “What is the title of the film that celebrates the role of the pioneering
women mathematicians at NASA in the 1960s?”</p>
<p>Most of you correctly identified the film as Hidden Figures. Let’s start by
watching the trailer.</p>
<p></p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" id="youtubeplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RK8xHq6dfAo?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>

</ul>


<div class="solution"><p>The answer is 300 hours, which the mother immediately converts into 12½ days.</p></div></div><p>The film tells the story of three brilliant black women who helped send the
American astronauts into space. These are just a few of the many women who
played a crucial role in the space race. It is a terrific film, which received
three Oscar nominations and which is both inspiring and exciting. Well worth
watching if your parents or teacher can get hold of the DVD.</p>

<h2 id="2-moores-law">2. Moore's Law</h2>
<p>The women were known as “computers”, because the original term computer
referred to a person who did calculations. Only later did the term computer
become more associated with machines. Increasingly, machine computers at NASA
took over from human computers, and many of the women became some of the first
computer programmers and operators. Those early computers were incredibly
difficult to operate and relatively slow, certainly compared to today’s
computers, as discussed in a blogpost on the ZME Science website:</p>
<p><em>…back on Earth at the Goddard Space Flight Center thousands of flight
technicians and computer experts employed the IBM System/360 Model 75s
mainframe computer to make independent computations and maintain communication
between Earth and lunar landers. These computers cost $3.5 million a piece and
were the size of a car. Each could perform several hundred thousand addition
operations per second, and their total memory capacity was in the megabyte
range. Programs were developed for the 75s that monitored the spacecraft’s
environmental data and astronauts’ health, which were at the time the most
complex software ever developed. Today, however, even a simple USB stick or
WiFi router is more powerful, let alone an iPhone. The iPhone 6 uses an
Apple-designed 64 bit Cortex A8 ARM architecture composed of approximately 1.6
billion transistors. It operates at 1.4 GHZ and can process instructions at a
rate of approximately 1.2 instructions every cycle in each of its 2 cores.
That’s 3.36 billion instructions per second. Put simply, the iPhone 6’s clock
is 32,600 times faster than the best Apollo era computers and could perform
instructions 120,000,000 times faster. You wouldn’t be wrong in saying an
iPhone could be used to guide 120,000,000 Apollo era spacecraft to the moon,
all at the same time.</em></p>
<p>Transistors are important components of computer circuitry, and the more transistors a computer circuit has, the more calculations it can do at one time.</p>
<p>This remarkable improvement in computing is known as Moore’s Law. Wikipedia
says:</p>
<p><em>Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense
integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is
named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel,
whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components
per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for
at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he
revised the forecast to doubling every two years</em></p>
<p>You might not find this doubling of the number of transistors on a computer
circuit particularly impressive, but it is actually mind-blowing. It has
literally changed civilisation.</p>
<p>When something doubles, and doubles again, and again and again … then the
results are phenomenal. It is a type of increase known as exponential growth.
The graph below shows Moore’s Law between 1971 and 2011. Take note of the funny
scale on the y-axis, which increases by a factor of 10 at each step. So, in 40
years, the number of transistors on a microprocessor increased from 2,300 to
2,600,000,000, which is an increase by a factor of more than a million.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>The 80486 had roughly 1,000,00 transistors, and the AMD K8 had about 100,000,000
transistors, so there was an increase by a factor of 100.</p></div></div><h2 id="3-the-chess-problem">3. The Chess Problem</h2>
<p>There is a very old story that demonstrates the power of exponential growth and
Moore’s Law, but it relates to chess and rice, not computers and transistors.</p>
<p>In India, or Persia or somewhere east of the English Channel, the King or
Maharajah or Sultan wanted to reward a mathematician, because he had just
invented chess. The King offered a chest of gold coins or a barrel of diamonds,
but instead the mathematician asked for a grain of rice on the first square of a
chessboard, 2 grains on the second square, 4 grains on the third square and so
on, doubling the number of grains of rice on each square until the 64th square.</p>
<p>The King laughed at what seem like a trivial reward, but he did not laugh for
long.</p>
<p>Grab a piece of paper and work out the number of grains of rice on each of the
first 32 squares. You will almost certainly need a calculator, and make sure you
check your answers. I have given you a headstart by listing the answers for the
first 10 squares.</p>

arrive at 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains on the 64th square.</p>
<p>If you want to add up all the grains on all the squares, then the total is double
the number of grains on the final square minus 1. (You can check this by looking
at the table above. The total number of grains for the first, say, five squares
is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31, which is the same as [2 × 16] – 1 = 31.)</p>
<p>This means that the total number of grains on all 64 squares is:
(2 × 9,223,372,036,854,775,808) – 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.</p>
<p>That is about 100 billion tonnes of rice, which is about hundred times more rice
than the whole Earth grows each year. That is the power of exponential growth.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>To count 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains will take 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
seconds, which is roughly 18 × 1018 sec = 3 × 1017 mins = 5 × 1015 hours = 2.1 ×
1014 days = 5.8 × 1011 years = 580 billion years, so the answer is roughly 600

<p>Sumaze! is a terrific new game that tests your core maths skills.</p>
<p>You will have access to 9 levels of the game, starting with some really trivial
ones to allow you to understand the game, followed by some trickier levels. You
score 1 point for level 1, 2 points for level 2, 3 points for level 3 and so on
until 9 points for level 9.</p>
<p>However, you will lose 2 points for every hint you use (available on levels 8 &amp; 9). And if you have to restart a
level then you will lose 1 point each time, up to a maximum of 4 lost points. So, if you need one hint on level 9,
then your maximum score goes from 9 down to 7. And if you succeed after restarting three times,
then your score drops from 7 down to 4.</p>
<p>It is easier to understand Sumaze! by experiencing it, but in case it helps here are a few important rules and tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim – to move your blue box to reach the “end of level” square.</li>
<li>Your box cannot at any time contain a number bigger than 1,000.</li>
<li>Your box cannot at any time contain a number that is a fraction.</li>
<li>You sometimes need keys to open doors to reach the “end of level” square.</li>
<li>Passing through an arrow means you cannot go back.</li>
<li>To pass through a green square you must satisfy the square’s condition.</li>
<li>Pink squares (and their operations) disappear when you move onto them.</li>
<li>Lilac squares (and their operations) can be crossed over and over again.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT – Sumaze won't run on a smartphone. If you are currently on a smartphone,
then type this into your PC/Mac/tablet browser: bit.ly/parallel_sumaze</li>
<li>If you want to explore more Sumaze puzzles, then check out the Additional Stuff section.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can stop and start Sumaze!, and the website will use cookies to remember your level and score so far,
but it is better to finish all the levels once you have started.</p>

<div class="solution"><p>The squares that receive more than one mark are those which contain integers
which are divisible by at least two of the integers 3, 5 and 7. The integers 3
and 5 are coprime, that is, they have no common factor other than 1. Therefore
the integers that are divisible by 3 and 5 are precisely those that are
divisible by 3 × 5, that is, by 15. Every 15th integer is divisible by 15. Hence
the number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by
15 is (<span class="math" v-pre=""><mn>150</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>15</mn></span>) which is 10.</p><p>Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 3 and 7 are precisely those that
are divisible by <span class="math" v-pre=""><mn>3</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>21</mn></span>. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 21 is 7, because 21 divides into 150 only 7 (and a bit) times.</p><p>Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 5 and 7 are precisely those that are divisible by <span class="math" v-pre=""><mn>5</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>35</mn></span>. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 35 is 4, because 35 divides into 150 only 4 (and a bit) times.</p><p>So it seems that we have <span class="math" v-pre=""><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn></span> (or 21) numbers that will have multiple marks because they have multiple divisors.</p><p>However, you need to check for numbers that are divisible by 3, 5 and 7, because they would have been counted three times, not just once – when you look for numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, then 3 and 7, then 5 and 7. In fact, the only number less than 150 divisible by 3, 5 and 7 is 105, so you only need to remove 2 from your tally, i.e., the answer is <span class="math" v-pre=""><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>–</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>19</mn></span>.</p></div></div><hr>
