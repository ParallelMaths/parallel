<ol>
<li>a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.</li>
<li>But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.</li>
<li>Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.</li>
<li>Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> – you will get points for every correct answer, but lose points if you use hints.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.</p>
<h2 id="1-four-random-dots-create-something-wonderful">1. Four random dots create something wonderful</h2>
<p>Okay. Grab a pencil, paper and ruler.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make 4 random dots (or ask someone else to make them for you).</li>
<li>Join up the dots to make a quadrilateral.</li>
<li>Put a mark at the midpoint of each line in this first quadrilateral.</li>
<li>Join up the four new points to make a new second quadrilateral.</li>

<p>The reason for the pretty mathematical image above is that I wanted to create a buffer between the question and the answer... which I am now about to tell you.</p>
<p>If you followed the instructions above, you should have ended up with a parallelogram. I find it shocking that you can start with four random dots and then end up with a perfect parallelogram, as shown here.</p>
<figure><img src="/resources/7-04-sundogs-random-dots/1-parallelogram-diagram.png" alt="" image="" align="center"></figure>
<p>You can test this by playing around with the interactive graphic on this page on the <a href="https://www.mathopenref.com/parallelograminscribed.html" target="_blank">Math Open Reference website</a>. You can drag the four orange dots wherever you want, and it automatically generates the first quadrilateral, the midpoints and the second internal quadrilateral, which is always a parallelogram.</p>

<p>I spotted this on a NASA website called <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/" target="_blank">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>, even though it is a video, not a picture. It shows the Sun as it was observed in Sweden in 2017.</p>
<p></p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" id="youtubeplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6c0wTtq4xDM?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>According to the NASA website, the Sun looks weird because the air is full of ice crystals, which behave like millions of tiny lenses:</p>
<p><em>“Water may freeze in the atmosphere into small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals. As these crystals flutter to the ground, much time is spent with their faces flat and parallel to the ground. An observer may find themselves in the same plane as many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, refracting sunlight into our view and creating phenomena like “parhelia”, the technical term for sundogs. Visible in the centre is the most direct image of the Sun, while two bright sundogs glow prominently from both the left and the right. Also visible is the bright 22-degree halo -- as well as the rarer and much fainter 46-degree halo –  also created by sunlight reflecting off of atmospheric ice crystals.”</em></p>
<p>There is a different Astronomy Picture of the Day each day, so visit regularly if you are interested in the universe.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we discussed how you can encode a message by turning each letter into a number according to the alphabet-number pairings below, adding a fixed number to each letter-number and then turning the new numbers back into letters.</p>
<p>If you want to decode a message, then you just reverse the process, so you subtract the fixed number, rather than adding it. <a href="/7-02-marie-curie" target="_blank">If any of this sounds unfamiliar or confusing, then revisit Parallelogram 2 by way of revision</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are already asking the following question: instead of adding a number, can we multiply by a number?</p>
<p>Let’s give it a go and find out what happens.</p>
<p>Let’s encode the word BAT by multiplying by 2. First, turn BAT into numbers: 1 ¦ 0 ¦ 19.</p>
<p>If we multiply each number by 2, then the result is 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 38, but we don’t allow numbers bigger than 25, because our alphabet only stretches from 0 to 25. Therefore, we subtract 26 from 38, and the result is 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 12, which translates to the letters CAM.</p>
<p><strong class="text-center">BAT is encoded as CAM.</strong></p>
<p>So far, so good. Now let’s encode the letters of the word BAG by multiplying by 2. BAG is first turned into the numbers 1 ¦ 0 ¦ 6.</p>
<p>If we multiply each number by 2, then the result is 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 12, which translates to the letters CAM.</p>
<p><strong class="text-center">BAG is encoded as CAM.</strong></p>
<p>Hang on! BAT is encoded as CAM, but BAG is also encoded as CAM. How can two different words be encoded into the same word? This is a serious problem. If someone sent you the coded word CAM, then you would not know if they meant BAT or BAG.</p>
<p>The problem arises because there are two ways of encoding something into M:</p>
<table class="grid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>G = 6</td>
<td>2 × 6 = 12</td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>12 = M</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T = 19</td>
<td>2 × 19 = 38</td>
<td>38 – 26 = 12</td>
<td><strong>12 = M</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Actually, there are two ways of encoding into every letter. For example,</p>
<table class="grid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A = 0</td>
<td>2 × 0 = 0</td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N  = 13</td>
<td>2 × 13 = 26</td>
<td>26 – 26 = 0</td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And:</p>
<table class="grid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B = 1</td>
<td>2 × 1 = 2</td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>2 = C</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>O = 14</td>
<td>2 × 14 = 28</td>
<td>28 – 26 = 2</td>
<td><strong>2 = C</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And:</p>
<table class="grid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>C = 2</td>
<td>2 × 2 = 4</td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>4 = E</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P = 15</td>
<td>2 × 15 = 30</td>
<td>30 – 26 = 4</td>
<td><strong>4 = E</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There is a pattern here. The two letters that are encoded in the same way (A &amp; N), (B &amp; O), (C &amp; P) are all 13 letters apart. Why 13? Well, we are multiplying by 2 and there are 26 letters in the alphabet, and 26/2 = 13.</p>
<p>The problem of different letters being encoded in the same way arises because we are multiplying by 2, and 2 is factor of 26, which is the size of our alphabet.</p>
<p>A similar problem would arise if we were multiplying by 13, because 13 is a factor of 26. This time the problem is much worse, because A, C, E, G,…. are all encoded in the same way and become A.</p>
<table class="grid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A = 0</td>
<td>13 × 0 = 0</td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C = 2</td>
<td>13 × 2 = 26</td>
<td>26 – 26 = 0</td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E = 4</td>
<td>13 × 4 = 52</td>
<td>52 – 26 – 26 = 0</td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G = 6</td>
<td>13 × 6 = 78</td>
<td>78 – 26 – 26 – 26 = 0</td>
<td><strong>0 = A</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Also, B, D, F, H,... are all encoded in the same way and become N.</p>
<p>Everything in this section is probably new maths to you, or at least applied in a new way, so don’t worry if you are a bit baffled. If you are a bit confused, then just read this section again – slowly –  and try to make sense of it. Then have a go at the questions below.</p>
<p>By the way, the notion that encoded numbers must be between 0 and 25 is called modulo 26 arithmetic or MOD (26), and this topic was covered in <a href="/7-02-marie-curie" target="_blank">Parallelogram 2</a>. It might help to review this if you are unsure why, for example, 30 is the same as 4 modulo (26).</p>

<div class="solution"><p>O = 14, and 5 × 14 = 70, which is bigger than 26 so we have start subtracting 26s to bring it within the range of 0 to 25. Thus, 70 – 26 – 26 = 18, and <strong>18 is the letter S</strong>.</p><p>K = 10, and 5 × 10 = 50. To bring it within the range of 0 – 25, we work out 50 – 26 = 24, and <strong>24 is the letter Y</strong>.</p></div></div><p>We found that encoding by multiplying by 2 or 13 was a problem, because these numbers are both factors of 26, the size of the English alphabet. In fact, there is also a problem when you multiply by any even number, because all the even numbers have a common factor with 26, namely 2.</p>

<p>Take a look at this.</p>
<p></p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" id="youtubeplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-dh7COSiB7g?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>How did “Magdalen - Binnie” work it out so quickly?</p>
<p>As he mentions at the end, it’s all down to modular arithmetic, which is something we’ve been using to work out some of the answers to do with codes over the last week or two.</p>
<p>In this case, the question is what day is 100 days after Monday? The days of the week operate according to modulo 7, so we just need to work out 100 in MOD(7).</p>
<p><strong>100 ÷ 7 = 14 remainder 2</strong>,	so <strong>100 in MOD(7) is 2</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, 100 days is 14 weeks + 2 days.</p>
<p>14 weeks after Monday bring us back to Monday, and 2 more days take us to Wednesday.</p>
