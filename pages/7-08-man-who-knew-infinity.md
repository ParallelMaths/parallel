## 1. The tale of Ramanujan

S. Ramanujan was one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. His story has even been turned into a movie, because he led such a remarkable life. He was born near the city of Madras in India in 1887, and his family were relatively poor, so he never went to university. However, he seemed to have a gift for mathematics and began creating new mathematical ideas that were far beyond the comprehension of his friends and family. Fortunately, a Cambridge professor called G.H. Hardy heard about this incredible young mathematician and invited Ramanujan to Cambridge University, where his genius flourished. Nevertheless, settling into his new life, far from his family, was a daily struggle.

Here is a clip from “The Man Who Knew Infinity”, all about the life of Ramanujan.

__1.1.__ In the clip, one of the mathematicians asks about Ramanujan’s first name. What does the S. stand for? The answer is not in the clip, so you might need to search online for the answer.

* [ ] Shivesh
* [x] Srinivasa
* [ ] Sushim
* [ ] Sutosh
* [ ] Swanand

__1.2.__ At one point in the clip, Ramanujan touches the feet of a statue of Isaac Newton, and you glimpse Newton’s memorial inscription. It is in Latin. Your challenge is to find the inscription, note down the Latin phrase, find out what it means and fill in the missing word: “Whose genius _____ the human race.”

## 2.	Partitions

Ramanujan was interested in something called partitions.  

Partitions explores how many ways it is possible break up a positive number into positive whole numbers.  

For example, 1 can only be (1).  
So, there is only __1 way__ to partition __1__.  

However, 2 can be (2) or (1 + 1).  
So, there are __2 ways__ to partition __2__.  

3 can be (3) or (1 + 2) or (1 + 1 + 1).  
So, there are __3 ways__ to partition __3__.

## 3.	Junior Maths Challenge Problem
<!--- (2014) Q1 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ What is (999 − 99 + 9) ÷ 9?

* [ ] 91
* [ ] 99
* [ ] 100
* [x] 101
* [ ] 109

---

We can calculate the value in more than one way.  

One method is to first work out the value of the expression in the brackets and then divide the result by 9. This gives:  

(999 − 99 + 9) ÷ 9 = 909 ÷ 9 = 101.

Alternatively, we can first divide each number in the bracket by 9 and then evaluate the resulting expression. This gives:

(999 − 99 + 9) ÷ 9 = (111 − 11 + 1) = 101.

Of course, both methods give the same answer.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelogams.

Cheerio,
Simon.
