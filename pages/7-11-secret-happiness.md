# _Year 7 • Parallelogram 11_ The Secret of Happiness 

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch
your brain.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
* Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. The Zen of Venn

We have looked at various Venn diagrams in recent weeks, but perhaps this is the most important one. It is a guide for life. Ikigai, which is the bit in the centre, is your “reason for being”. It describes the thing that you love, which the world needs, which you are good at and which you can be paid for. Find that thing and you will be happy for your whole life.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Which of the following expressions has the largest value?

* [ ] 1 – 0.1
* [ ] 1 – 0.01
* [ ] 1 – 0.001
* [ ] 1 – 0.0001
* [x] 1 – 0.00001

---

In each case a number is subtracted from 1. The smaller the number we subtract, the larger the answer will be. So the largest value is obtained when the smallest number is subtracted.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ Heidi is 2.1 m tall, while Lola is only 1.4 m tall. What is their average height?

* [ ] 1.525 m
* [ ] 1.6 m
* [ ] 1.7 m
* [ ] 1.725 m
* [x] 1.75 m

---

The average height, in metres, is `(2.1+1.4)/2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75` m.

## 4. QI – what is the correct way to cut a cake?

Here is something for you to think about from BBC2’s QI show, which often features mathematical puzzles. You will hear the question in the video clip, but here it is so there is no confusion. If you cut a standard slice of cake (basically a triangle, with one curved side), then the sides next to the removed slice are exposed to the air and will dry out.  

__So, how do you cut the cake in a radically difference way (3 cuts, 2 pieces please), so that you minimise the amount of cut cake exposed to the drying effects of the air?__  

Perhaps pause the video and think about possible solutions before they give you the answer.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=5_1 marks=3

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 25
* [ ] 35
* [x] 40
* [ ] 65
* [ ] 155

Let the other angles be as marked in the diagram. Then `y = 65` as the angles marked 65°
and `y`° are the base angles of an isosceles triangle.

Because the angles in a triangle sum to `180°, z = 180 - 65 - 65 = 50`.

Now, `w = z`, as the angles marked `w`° and `z`° are vertically opposite. Therefore `w = 50`. So, the angle marked `x`° is the third angle of a triangle in which the other two angles are 50° and 90°.

Therefore `x = 180 - 50 - 90 = 40`.

## 6. What is 0!

We have covered factorials in recent Parallelograms. Remember 3! just means 3 × 2 x 1 = 6.  

Or 5! means 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

But what is 0! (zero factorial)?

James Grime explores this question in this video, but have a think about the answer before you hear James’s take on this mystery.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next
Parallelogram.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe
take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Additional Stuff

* QI explores physics by seeing what happens when you take two large books and weave the pages – they are impossible to pull apart. Try it for yourself.

* Mythbusters took the phenomenon to the next level, and then the next level again.

* ![](/resources/7-11-secret-happiness/7-additional-pages.jpg){image align="right"} [This article from Chalkdust magazine](http://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/why-is-it-so-hard-to-pull-two-phone-books-apart/ ){target="_blank"} explains why interleaved books are so sticky. It is fairly technical, but worth a quick look. It is written for university students, but it is worth a quick look and don’t worry if you are confused by some bits.
