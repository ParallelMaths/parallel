*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

__1.1__ Which is smallest?

* [ ] `(2 + 3)/(4 + 6)`
* [ ] `(2 ÷ 3)/(4 ÷ 6)`
* [ ] `23/46`
* [ ] `(2 - 3)/(4 - 6)`
* [x] `(2 × 3)/(4 × 6)`
{.col-5}

---

The values are respectively `1/2`, `1`, `1/2`, `1/2`, `1/4`.

__2.1__ Here are three statements:

(i) `3^10` is even  
(ii) `3^10` is odd  
(iii) `3^10` is square  

Exactly which ones are true?

* [ ] (i) only
* [ ] (ii) only
* [ ] (iii) only
* [ ] (i) and (iii)
* [x] (ii) and (iii)
{.col-5}

---

All powers of 3 are odd and `3^10 = 3^5 × 3^5` which means that `3^10` is also square.

__3.1__ A rectangular sheet of paper with sides 1 and `sqrt(2)` has been folded once as shown, so that one corner just meets the opposite long edge.  

What is the value of the length `d`?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `sqrt(2) - 1`
* [ ] `7/16`
* [ ] `sqrt(3) - sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `sqrt(2)/3`

The fold is made along `BE`. `A` folds onto `A'`.

`A'B = AB = sqrt(2)`, therefore `A'C = 1` (by Pythagoras).

The fold is made along `BE`. `A` folds onto `A'`.  

`A'B = AB = sqrt(2)`, therefore `A'C = 1` (by Pythagoras).  

Triangle `A'BC` is therefore a right-angled isosceles triangle, therefore `BA'C = 45°`, therefore `EA'D = 45°`.  

Thus `ED = A'D = sqrt(2) - 1`.

__4.1__ In a magic square, each row, each column and both main diagonals have the same total.  

In the partially completed magic square shown, what number should replace `x`?

* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
* [x] 21
* [ ] 24
* [ ] 27
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=1
The leading diagonal sums to 58. So every row and column should add to 58.
^^^

---

The numbers along the leading diagonal total 58 and this is therefore the sum of each row and column. We can now calculate that the number to the left of the 10 must be 20, and the number below that is 7. Hence `x = 58 - (16 + 14 + 7) = 21`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ Sally explains that the bell requires 1 nanoamp (nA) of current. How much is a nanoamp?

* [ ] A trillionth of an amp.
* [x] A billionth of an amp.
* [ ] A millionth of an amp.
* [ ] A thousandth of an amp.
* [ ] A hundredth of an amp.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
