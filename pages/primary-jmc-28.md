If you start with three numbers, the 'addition machine' produces three new ones by adding together each pair of two. 

For instance from the numbers {3, 4, 6} the addition machine makes {10, 9, 7}.  

If you use the addition machine again these numbers become {16, 17, 19}.  

We feed the three numbers {20, 1, 3} into the addition machine and let the machine calculate 2013 times.  

What is the biggest possible difference between two of the three resulting numbers?
