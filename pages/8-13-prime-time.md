__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Primes against the clock

Below is a simple website that tests how well you know your prime numbers and how quickly you can apply some prime tests. It will show you a series of numbers and you have to decide whether or not they are prime. If you do not know straight away, then there are some easy checks that you can apply to filter out the non-primes:

-	If it is even, then it is divisible by 2.
-	If the digits add to 3, 6, or 9, then it is divisible by 3.
-	If it ends with a 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.
-	Remember, 1 is NOT a prime.

Just visit the [Is this a prime?](http://isthisprime.com/game/){target="_blank"} website and see how many numbers you can identify as primes or non-primes.

<!--- (2014) Q6 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
![](/resources/8-13-prime-time/3-stripes.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1__ The diagram shows a square divided into strips of equal width.  

Three strips are black and two are grey.

What fraction of the perimeter of the square is grey?

* [x] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `4/25`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [ ] `2/5`
{.col-5}

---

Two sides of the square are wholly black, and `2/5` of two sides are grey.

So the length of the perimeter that is grey is equal to 2 × `2/5` = `4/5` of the length of one side.

The length of the perimeter is 4 times the length of one side.

So the fraction of the perimeter that is grey is `(4/5)/4 = 1/5`

::: problem id=3_2 marks=3
__3.2__ A square is divided into seven strips of equal width. Four of the strips are black and three are grey.

What fraction of the perimeter of the square is grey?

* [ ] `1/28`
* [x] `3/14`
* [ ] `1/7`
* [ ] `3/7`
* [ ] `11/14`
{.col-5}

---

Two sides of the square are wholly black, and `3/7` of two sides are grey.

So the length of the perimeter that is grey is equal to `2 × 3/7 = 6/7` of the length of one side.

The length of the perimeter is 4 times the length of one side.

So the fraction of the perimeter that is grey is `6/7 ÷ 4 = 6/28 = 3/14`.

::: problem id=3_3 marks=3
__3.3__ A square is divided into an odd number of strips of equal width.

The strips are alternately black and grey, with one more black strip than grey strips. The fraction of the perimeter that is grey is `6/25`.

How many strips are there?

<input type="number" solution="25"/>

---

We don’t know the number of strips, but we could call it `NS`, and we know that the number of grey strips is `1/2(NS − 1)`.  

We know that 2 sides of the square have no grey, because there is no grey strip that touches any corner or which stretches along any side.  

We know that along the other two sides, the fraction of grey on the perimeter is `1/2(NS − 1) ÷ NS`.  

So, if we can say the square has unit length 1, then the fraction of grey along the perimeter is:  

`(0 + 0 + (1/2(NS − 1) ÷ NS) + (1/2(NS − 1) ÷ NS))/4` = `6/25`  

`(NS – 1)/NS` = `24/25`  

If you rearrange and simplify this equation, then NS = 25.

__3.4__ Imagine that the square has trillion-and-one black strips and a trillion grey strips What fraction (give or take a bit) of the perimeter of the square is grey?

* [ ] `0`
* [ ] `1/16`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=3_4 marks=2
Two sides of the square will be black, as previously. The other two sides will effectively be half black and half grey, because the difference between a trillion and a trillion-and-one is insignificant.
^^^

Two sides of the square will be black, as previously. The other two sides will effectively be half black and half grey, because the difference between a trillion and a trillion-and-one is insignificant. So, the fraction of the perimeter that is grey is ( ¼ + ¼ ) ÷ 4 = ¼.

## 4.	Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2014) Q7 --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1__ What is 2014 − 4102?

* [ ] -2012
* [x] -2088
* [ ] -2092
* [ ] -2098
* [ ] -2112
{.col-5}

---

It is easier to subtract the smaller number, 2014, from the larger number, 4102. Now

4102 − 2014 = 2088

and so

2014 − 4102 = −2088.

## 5. History of Mathematics

The terrific Mathigon website has loads of great material, including a timeline showing the great mathematicians of past centuries. Visit the [timeline](https://mathigon.org/timeline){target="_blank"} (click and it will open up in a new tab) and answer the three questions below. __Just enter the name given in the plum box__.

So, if the answer is John Napier, just enter __Napier__, because that is the name that appears in the plum-coloured box on the timeline:

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
