__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s the last normal Parallelogram of the school year... so it’s a toughie - and even better there is a super-giant Parallelogram next week to keep you busy over the summer holidays. Actually, it is not super-giant, just bigger than a normal Parallelogram. That’s because it is important that you do a bit of mathematics every week between the end of the summer term and the start of the autumn term to stop your brain from turning to sludge. Good luck!


## 1. Pet Puzzle

A cat and a dog weigh 10 Kg. A dog and a rat weigh 7 Kg. And a cat and a rat weigh 5 Kg.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ What is the combined weight of a dog, cat and rat?  

(See if you can find a quick way to solve this problem.)

<input solution="11"/> kg

---

__SLOW APPROACH__  

(1)	C + D = 10  
(2)	D + R = 7  
(3)	C + R = 5  

Line (1) tells us that C = 10 – D, so we can swap the C in line (3) to give us…  

[10 – D] + R = 5.  

This means that R = D – 5, and we can swap this into line (2) to give us …  

D + [D – 5] = 7  
2D = 12  
D = 6.  

If D = 6, then line (1) tells us that C = 4.  

Then line (3) tells us that R = 1.  

So, the total weight is D + C + R = 6 + 4 + 1 = 11 Kg.  

__QUICK APPROACH__  

If we add (1) + (2) + (3), then we have two of each animal, which means.  

2D + 2C + 2R = 10 + 7 + 5 = 22.  

So, D + C + R = 11 Kg.

__3.1__ The diagram shows a partially completed magic square, in which all rows, all columns and both main diagonals have the same total.  

What is the value of `x + y`?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 12
* [x] 13
* [ ] 14
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=3_1
Label the number in the top right hand corner as “`w`”. This completes two lines, which are a diagonal and the right-hand column. We know that the totals in this diagonal and the right-hand column must be the same.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3_2
The total of the diagonal is (`6 + 7 + w`), and the total of the column is (`x + y + w`), so what must (`x + y`) be equal to?
^^^

---

![](/resources/7-34-pet-puzzle/3-magic-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
Let w be the number in the top-right square, as shown in the figure.  

Because we are dealing with a magic square, the total of the numbers in the right-hand column is the same as the total of the numbers in the diagonal from the bottom-left square to the top-right square.  

This gives  

`x + y + w = 6 + 7 + w`.  

Hence, by subtracting w from both sides, we deduce that  

`x + y = 6 + 7`.  

It follows that  

`x + y = 13`.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ How many integers are greater than `20 + 18` and also less than `20 × 18`?

* [ ] 320
* [x] 321
* [ ] 322
* [ ] 323
* [ ] 324
{.col-5}

---

We have `20 + 18 = 38` and `20 × 18 = 360`.  

The integers that are greater than 38 and less than 360 are the integers from 39 to 359, inclusive.  

There are `(359 − 39) + 1`, that is, 321 of these integers.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2018 (8) --->

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ Gill scored a goal halfway through the second quarter of a ‘teachers versus pupils’ netball match.  

At that point, what fraction of the whole match remained to be played?

* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `5/8`
* [ ] `3/4`
{.col-5}

---

Because `1/2 × 1/4 = 1/8`, a half of a quarter is one eighth.  

At the time when Gill scored the goal the first quarter and half the second quarter of the whole match had been completed. So the fraction of the game that had been completed was  

`1/4 + 1/8 = 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8`.  

Therefore the fraction of the game that remained to be played was  

`1 − 3/8 = 8/8 − 3/8 = 5/8`
:::

::: problem id=5_2 marks=2
__5.2__ Gill scored a second goal one-third of the way through the third quarter of the netball match. At that point, what fraction of the whole match remained to be played?

* [ ] `7/12`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `5/12`
* [ ] `2/3`
* [ ] `1/4`
{.col-5}

---

The second goal was scored after:  

`1/4 + 1/4 + (1/3 × 1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/12 = 3/12 + 3/12 + 1/12 = 7/12` of the game.  

So, `5/12` of the game remained

__6.1__ Beatrix places copies of the L-shape shown on a `4 × 4` board so that each L-shape covers exactly three cells of the board.  

She is allowed to turn around or turn over an L-shape.  

What is the largest number of L-shapes she can place on the board without overlaps?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=6_1
The answer is not 4 shapes.

![](/resources/7-34-pet-puzzle/6-l-squares-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
The figure shows one way of placing 5 L-shapes on the board without overlaps.  

The 4 × 4 board is made up of 16 cells. The L-shape is made up of 3 cells.  

Therefore, however 5 L-shapes are placed on the board without overlapping, there will be just one cell that remains uncovered. So there will not be space for one more L-shape.  

Hence, the largest number of L-shapes that Beatrix can place on the board without overlaps is 5.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
