## 1. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2005) Q5 --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ How many of the following statements are true?

- Any number which is divisible by 6 is even.  
- Any number which is divisible by 9 is odd.  
- The sum of any two odd numbers is even.  
- The sum of any two even numbers is odd.  

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

If a number is divisible by 6 then it must also be divisible by 2, so it is even. ‘The sum of any two odd numbers is even’ is also true. However, not all multiples of 9 are odd (e.g. 18) and the sum of any two even numbers is even rather than odd, so two of the four statements are true.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=5
__2.1__ Trinni is fascinated by triangle numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.) and recently, coming across a clock, she found that she could rearrange the twelve numbers 1, 2, 3, … 12 around the face so that each adjacent pair added up to a triangle number.  

She left the 12 in its usual place; what number did she put where the 6 would usually be?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1 marks=2
It’s easy to work out which numbers are either side of the 12. It then does not matter which side the 3 and 9 go. It is then easy to work out which numbers go the other side of the 3 and 9. As you get to the end, it gets trickier, as there are some different options, but just remember that for every option clockwise and anticlockwise, the number has to be same at the bottom of the clock.

For ease of reference, label the points A, B, C,…, K as shown.  

First note that A = 3 and K = 9 or vice versa. With no loss of generality, let A = 3. Then the only possible values for B, C, and D are 7, 8 and 2 respectively. This gives E = 1 or 4 and, as K = 9, J = 1 or 6.  

If J = 1, then E = 4 and the only remaining possibilities for I, H and G are 5, 10 and 11 respectively.  

This means that F = 6, but 11 + 6 is not a triangle number, so J is not 1 and must, therefore, be 6. This means that
I = 4 and hence E = 1.  

The remaining values may now be assigned: H = 11, G = 10 and F = 5.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ A shop advertises ‘Buy one, get one at half price’. For this offer, the average cost per item is the same as:

* [ ] Two for the price of one  
* [ ] Three for the price of one  
* [ ] Three for the price of two  
* [x] Four for the price of three  
* [ ] Five for the price of four  

---

The offer gives the purchaser two items for the price of one and a half items.  

So the average cost per item is the same as four items for the price of three.

It might be easier to look at the area outside the triangle in order to work out the area of the triangle, or to see which option has a different triangle area.
^^^

---

The area of triangle `A = 1/2 × 2 × 3 = 3`;  
The area of parallelogram `B = 1 × 3 = 3`;  
The area of triangle `C = 1/2 × 3 × 2 = 3`;  
The area of rectangle `E = 1 × 3 = 3`.  
However, the area of triangle `D = 3 × 3 − (3 + 3 + 1/2) = 2 1/2`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ Platinum is a very rare metal, even rarer than gold. Its density is 21.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.  

Assuming that the world production has been about 110 tonnes for each of the past 50 years, and negligible before that, which of the following has a comparable volume to that of the total amount of platinum ever produced?


* [ ] a shoe box
* [ ] a cupboard
* [x] a house
* [ ] Buckingham Palace
* [ ] the Grand Canyon
{.col-5}

---

The volume of 1kg of platinum is (1000/21.45)cm<sup>3</sup>, that is approximately 50cm<sup>3</sup>.  

So 1 tonne of platinum has a volume of approximately 50,000cm<sup>3</sup>, which is `1/20`m<sup>3</sup>.  

The volume of platinum produced per year is therefore about 5m<sup>3</sup> and the total volume of platinum ever produced is approximately 250m<sup>3</sup>.  

This is the volume of a cuboid measuring 10m × 5m × 5m, which is comparable to a house.

## 6. The Googol machine      

This machine physically visualizes a googol (`10^100`). Watch and be awe struck. Each gear has a reduction of 10:1, so when the first wheel makes 10 rotations, the second wheel makes only 1 rotation. Then when the first wheel makes 100 rotations, the second wheel makes only 10 rotations, and the third wheel rotates once. If the first, or when, the first wheel makes a googol rotations, the final wheel will have made one rotation.
