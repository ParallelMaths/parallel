The pie chart on the right shows the numbers of pupils who answered the question “Is there life in Outer Space?" with a “yes” or “no”.  

There were 21 pupils who answered “yes”.  

How many pupils answered “no”?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [x] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

We can see that `1/4` replied “no” and `3/4` “yes”.  

Since 21 replied “yes”, the number that replied “no” was 21 ÷ 3 = 7.

Jonathan the tortoise eats 20 g of salad leaves a day.  

The leaves are sold in 80 g bags which cost 90p.  

How much would it cost to feed Jonathan for 4 weeks?  

* [ ] £4.20
* [ ] £4.80
* [ ] £5.30
* [ ] £5.70
* [x] £6.30
{.col-5}

There are 28 days in four weeks, and each bag of salad will last four days.  

Therefore Jonathan will require seven bags over the four weeks.  

This will cost Jonathan or his owners 7 × 90p = £6.30.
