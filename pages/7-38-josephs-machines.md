__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. History of Mathematics

As mentioned last week, the terrific Mathigon website has loads of great material, including a timeline showing the great mathematicians of past centuries. Visit the [timeline](https://mathigon.org/timeline){target="_blank"} (click and it will open up in a new tab) and answer the three questions below. __Just enter the name given in the plum box__.

So, if the answer is John Napier, just enter __Napier__, because that is the name that appears in the plum-coloured box on the timeline:

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2017 (23) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ The positive integers from 1 to 150 inclusive are placed in a 10 by 15 grid so that each cell contains exactly one integer. Then the multiples of 3 are given a red mark, the multiples of 5 are given a blue mark, and the multiples of 7 are given a green mark. How many cells have more than 1 mark?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
* [x] 19
{.col-5}

---
The squares that receive more than one mark are those which contain integers which are divisible by at least two of the integers 3, 5 and 7. The integers 3 and 5 are coprime, that is, they have no common factor other than 1. Therefore the integers that are divisible by 3 and 5 are precisely those that are divisible by 3 × 5, that is, by 15. Every 15th integer is divisible by 15. Hence the number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 15 is (`150 ÷ 15`) which is 10.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 3 and 7 are precisely those that
are divisible by `3 × 7 = 21`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 21 is 7, because 21 divides into 150 only 7 (and a bit) times.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 5 and 7 are precisely those that are divisible by `5 × 7 = 35`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 35 is 4, because 35 divides into 150 only 4 (and a bit) times.

So it seems that we have `10 + 7 + 4` (or 21) numbers that will have multiple marks because they have multiple divisors.

However, you need to check for numbers that are divisible by 3, 5 and 7, because they would have been counted three times, not just once – when you look for numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, then 3 and 7, then 5 and 7. In fact, the only number less than 150 divisible by 3, 5 and 7 is 105, so you only need to remove 2 from your tally, so that it is only counted once, i.e., the answer is `10 + 7 + 4 – 2 = 19`.

## 3. The Page Turner

If you scroll down, you will see one of my favourite YouTube videos, which features a complex machine designed just to turn the page of a newspaper. It is the work of the eccentric inventor Joseph Herscher. While you watch it, try to answer the questions below.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ The 4-ball encounters three goblets, but it does not drop into any of them because they are filled with:

* [ ] Sand
* [x] Balls
* [ ] Water
* [ ] Cheese
* [ ] Compressed air
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=2
__3.2__ How does the water move from a beaker to a sponge, causing the sponge to get heavier and tip down?

* [x] Boiling
* [ ] Freezing
* [ ] Pipe
* [ ] Pipette
* [ ] Suction

## 4. Another of Joseph’s machines – his longest machine ever

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ Another amazing invention by Joseph Herscher. Just one question. How many ping pong balls are tipped onto the table in order to just knock over a couple of dominos?

## 7. Parallel emails

If you use Parallel on an email address from your school, some school IT systems prevent you from receiving the emails we send out to remind you when a new Parallelogram is released, or when we have another exciting and nerdy maths thing to tell you about. To avoid this, you could give us a different email address we can contact you on - either a personal email address, or one for you parents or guardian. If you'd like to do that, [you can put it in this form](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/k6y9h6){target="_blank"}, but please ask a parent first if you are not yet 13 years old.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
__7.1__ If you do want to give us an alternate email address, be sure to click the link above (if you haven’t already). Either way, here's a free mark, just for being a fan of Parallel.

* [x] Thank you!

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
* The next Parallelogram will be out next Thursday at 3pm.


Cheerio,
Simon.
