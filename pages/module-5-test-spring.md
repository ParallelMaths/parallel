<input type="number" solution="100"/> 

---

Angles in a quadrilateral sum to 360°, so the missing angle, in degrees, is 360 - (155 + 55 + 50) = 100
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If there are twice as many girls as there are boys in a class, what is the ratio of boys to girls? 

* [ ] 1:1
* [x] 1:2
* [ ] 1:3
* [ ] 2:1
* [ ] 3:1
{.col-5}

---

For every boy there are two girls, so the ratio of boys to girls is 1:2.

## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is divisible by 2, 3 and 4? 

* [ ] 238
* [ ] 239
* [x] 240
* [ ] 241
* [ ] 242
{.col-5}

---

* 239 and 241 are odd and are therefore not divisible by 2   
* 238 and 242 are not divisible by 3 or 4 (use either divisibility check) 
* 240 is 24 × 10 and 24 = 2 × 3 × 4, so we can see that 240 contains these three factors 
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
Which of these is a regular quadrilateral? 

* [ ] Parallelogram
* [ ] Kite
* [ ] Rectangle
* [ ] Rhombus
* [x] Square

---

Regular means that all the sides have the same length and all the interior angles are equal (90° in the case of a quadrilateral).  

Only a square fits this description.  
:::


## 6.

Which of these is smallest? 

* [x] `2^5`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `6^2`
* [ ] `2^6`
* [ ] `8^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are: 

* `2^5 = 32`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `6^2 = 36`
* `2^6 = 64`
* `8^2 = 64`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What is the mean of the numbers 6, 6, 8, 10, 15? 

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

---

There are five numbers in the list so the mean is given by: 

`(6 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 15)/5 = 9`
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what is the probability that you get two sixes?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `1/36`
* [ ] `1/18`
{.col-5}

---

The probability is given by:  

`1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36`
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
FGHI is a rhombus, GF = GJ.  

![](/resources/module-5-test-spring/9-rhombus.png){image align="center"}  

What is the size, in degrees, of angle IHG? 

* [ ] 42 
* [ ] 69
* [x] 96
* [ ] 108
* [ ] 111
{.col-5}

---

Angle GJF = 69°, since angles on a line sum to 180°.  

Since GF = GJ, FJG is isosceles and angle FGJ = 180° – 2 × 69° = 42°.  

FG = FI (as FGHI is a rhombus), so angle GIF = angle FGI = 42°.  

Therefore, angle JFI = 180° – 111° – 42° = 27°.  

So angle IFG = 27° + 69° = 96°.  

In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, therefore angle IHG = 96° also. 
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
What is the distance between the points (-2, 4) and (3, 16)?

<input type="number" solution="13"/>

---

The horizontal distance is 5 and the vertical distance is 12 so from Pythagoras, the distance is `sqrt(5^2 + 12^2) = 13`.  
:::


## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
When 34 is divided by a positive integer N, the remainder is 2. What is the sum of all the possible values of N?

* [ ] 31
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 48
* [ ] 56
* [x] 60
{.col-5}

---

We are looking for numbers that are factors of 32 but not 34: they are 4, 8, 16, 32. These values sum to 60.
:::


## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
In a certain triangle, the size of each of the angles is a whole number of degrees.  

One angle is 60° larger than the average of the other two angles.  

What is the largest possible size of an angle in this triangle, in degrees?  

<input type="number" solution="100"/>

---

* Call the three angles `x`°, `y`°, `z`°.  
* Set `x` to be the angle that is 60° larger than the average of the other two, then `x = 60 + (y + z)/2`.  
* Substituting this into `x + y + z = 180` gives `60 + (y + z)/2 + y + z = 180`, which simplifies to `y + z = 80`.  
* Therefore x = 180 - 80 = 100 and this is guaranteed to be larger than y and z.

## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
Every pupil in a class either swims or skips.  

Four sevenths of the class swim and four sevenths skip. Six pupils both swim and skip.  

How many pupils are in the class?  

* [ ] 24
* [ ] 28
* [ ] 36
* [x] 42
* [ ] 48
{.col-5}

---

The fraction of the class who do both is 4/7 + 4/7 - 1 = 1/7.  

Hence, the number of pupils is 6 × 7 = 42.  
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
A sequence of positive integers starts with one 1, followed by two 2s, three 3s, and so on (each positive integer `n` occurs `n` times).  

How many of the first 120 numbers in this sequence are divisible by 5?  

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 25
* [x] 30
* [ ] 45
{.col-5}

---

The number of terms in the sequence up to and including the n occurrences of `n` is 1 + 2 + 3 + … + `n = 1/2n(n + 1)`, which is equal to 120 when `n` = 15.

Hence the numbers divisible by 5 are 5 (five times), 10 (ten times) and 15 (fifteen times), for a total of 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 numbers.

The diagram shows a large square which has been divided into four smaller squares.  

It also shows both diagonals of the large square and two diagonals of the smaller squares.  

What fraction of the area of the large square has been shaded? 

* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [ ] `5/8`
* [x] `9/16`
* [ ] `11/16`

---

* Starting on the top left square and going clockwise, the shaded parts make up `1/2`,`1/2`,`3/4` and `1/2` of their respective squares.   
* Each of the four squares is `1/4` of the whole square, so, as a fraction of the whole square, the shaded parts are `1/8`, `1/8`, `3/16` and `1/8`. 
* Sum these to get a total fraction of `9/16`.

A hexagon is formed by arranging three equilateral triangles, as shown in the diagram.  

The side-length of the largest equilateral triangle is 15cm.  

What is the perimeter, in cm, of the hexagon?

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 45
* [x] 60
* [ ] 75
* [ ] more information needed

---

Let the side-lengths, in cm, of the two smaller triangles be `x` and `y`, as shown.  

Then from the dotted line we can see that `x + y = 15`.  

The perimeter of the hexagon, in cm, is therefore:  

`15 + 15 + 2x + 2y = 30 + 2(x + y) = 30 + 30 = 60`

PWRS is a square with area 64 cm<sup>2</sup>`.  

The point T is inside the square.  

PTS is a triangle with area 17 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

What is the area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of the triangle QRT?

Denote the perpendicular heights of PTS and QRT h₁, h₂, respectively.  

The base of both triangles is the side length of the square, which is 8cm.   

So the areas of QRT and PTS are (in cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively, `1/2` × 8 × h₁ and `1/2` × 8 × h₂.  

The sum of these two areas is `1/2` × 8 × (h₁ + h₂).  

Now, h₁ + h₂  is the height of the square, so this simplifies to `1/2 × 8 × 8 = 32`.  

So the two triangles have a combined area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of 32 and since we are told that PTS has an area of 17 cm<sup>2</sup>, triangle QRT must make up the remaining 15 cm<sup>2</sup>.

Simon eats three equal-sized bowls of porridge, one after the other.  

When he has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, what fraction of the porridge in the second bowl has he eaten?  

* [x] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/9`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `2/15`
{.col-5}

---

Let the amount of porridge in each bowl be _p_.  

Then, when Simon has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, he has eaten
`4/9 × 3p = 4p/3 = p + p/3`, so he has eaten `1/3` of the second bowl.

## 19.
::: problem id=19_1 marks=1
The area of a square is eight times the area of a rectangle with a length half that of the square and a width 2cm less than the width of the square.  

What is the perimeter, in cm, of the square?  

* [ ] `8`
* [ ] `28/3`
* [x] `32/3`
* [ ] `12`
* [ ] `40/3`
{.col-5}


---
Call the side length of the square `2x`.  

Then the rectangle has length `x` and width `2x - 2`.  

The relevant equation is `(2x)^2 = 8x(2x - 2)`, which simplifies to `4x^2 = 8x(2x - 2)`.  

Since `x` is non-zero, we can divide both sides by `4x` to get `x = 2(2x - 2)`.  

Solve this to get `x = 4/3`, which means the perimeter, which is `8x`, is `32/3`.

From the results table below, where each team plays each other once, what was the score in the match between United and City?  

| Team | Win | Draw | Loss | Goals for | Goals against |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ------------- |
| Rovers | 3 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 |
| United | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 6 |
| City | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 |
| Wanderers | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 2 |   
{.grid}

* [ ] 0-0
* [ ] 1-1
* [ ] 2-2
* [x] 3-3
* [ ] 0-1
{.col-5}

---

* First we note that Rovers beat United and, since Rovers do not concede any goals and United draw their other two games, the scoreline is 3-0.
* So in their other two games, United draw both, scoring 3 and conceding 3.
* Wanderers do not score any goals, so it must have been 0-0 between United and Rovers.
* Therefore it was 3-3 between United and City.
