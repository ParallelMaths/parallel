*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. A great way to estimate

How would we estimate the number of squirrels in an area?  

Or the number of taxi cabs in London?  

Does someone need to count them all?  

Fortunately not, as we can use a clever piece of maths!  

Watch this video as Johnny Ball explains all.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What happens to the ping pong balls once they are “captured” and marked?  

* [ ] They are removed from the tank
* [x] They are returned to the tank
* [ ] Half of them are returned to the tank
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ Which of these describes the calculation after the experiment has run?

* [x] Second sample size ÷ Recapture amount × Original sample size
* [ ] Recapture amount × 100
* [ ] Recapture amount ÷ Original sample size × Second sample size
* [ ] Original sample size ÷ Recapture amount

--- 

There are a few different ways to perform this calculation. The one Johnny mentions is:  

__Second sample size ÷ Recapture amount × Original sample size__  

Though he does make life easier for himself by capturing the same amount each time and making the sample size a nice, neat 100.

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ If we ran the ping pong experiment again, marked and returned 100 balls, and then recaptured 100 balls, 40 of which were marked, what would you estimate the amount of balls in the entire tank to be?  

* [ ] 40
* [ ] 60
* [ ] 140
* [x] 250

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ One year I went to a woodland and captured 100 squirrels, and marked them.  

I then recaptured 100 squirrels, of which 20 were marked.  

The next year (by which point all the original marks had rubbed off), I captured another 100 squirrels and marked them.  

This time, when I recaptured 100 squirrels I saw that 40 were marked.  

What has happened to the population size in the last year?  

* [ ] Increased by 20
* [ ] It has doubled
* [x] It has halved
* [ ] Decreased by 20

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1 
What was the population to begin with?  

What was it in the second year?

## 2. Some puzzles!

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ The answer to 5 × 8 × 9 is the same as the answer to one of the calculations below. Which one?

* [ ] 8 × 14
* [ ] 40 × 5
* [x] 72 × 5
* [ ] 13 × 9
* [ ] 17 × 5
{.col-5}

---
You don't have to work out the answer to each sum!  

As multiplication can be done in any order (this is called the ‘commutative’ property)  

you can group the 8 × 9 together to give 72, and then you still need to multiply by 5.
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ Pills are sold in rectangular arrays.  

Which number could only make a long and very thin rectangular, pack of pills?  

* [ ] 12
* [x] 13
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 16
{.col-5}

---

As 13 is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and 13.  

So it must be sold in a long thin pack, 1 × 13.  

All of the other numbers are composite and can be solved in multiple ways, e.g. for 12 pills:  

* 1 row of 12  
* 2 rows of 6  
* or 3 rows of 4

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
