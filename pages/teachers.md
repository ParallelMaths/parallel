# Introduction for Teachers

Parallel is an opportunity for your students to broaden their mathematical
horizons and stretch their brains via a series of weekly web-based maths sheets,
known as Parallelograms, published online at 3pm each Thursday.

Each maths sheet is set by Simon Singh, author of several best-selling books,
and questions are automatically marked and explanations are provided.

The material is all FREE and you are welcome to use it in any way that helps.
You could do each weekly Parallelogram in class as a group, but the material is
better-suited to being completed at home. You could point your students
towards the website and they can create their own accounts and continue
independently of you.

However, we think __the best way to use this resource__ is to create a teacher
account and encourage your whole class or part of your class to complete the
Parallelograms each week. Your students should be fairly keen and fairly strong
mathematicians, as this is an extra dose of maths (albeit fun) at the weekend,
but if you and they are willing to take part then there are big advantages to
having a teacher account:

1. Parallelograms will be automatically marked.
2. You will have access to all the student scores.
3. Scoresheets will highlight excellent students and those who are
   struggling, so that you can easily recognise achievement or offer
   encouragement.
4. Students will be more motivated if they are part of a class account.
5. The Parallelogram becomes a routine that builds skill, interest and
   confidence week after week.

So, why not give it a try. [Signing up as a teacher](/signup#teacher) is quick, easy and free, and if it is not for you then you drop out at any time.

__Please note:__ In order for pupils to receive the weekly email reminder to take part in the latest Parallelograms and successfully manage their account and password, you may need your school's IT department to whitelist the following addresses:
