## 1. Adding up 5 numbers

This question was offered up at my son’s school, as one of their monthly puzzles.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ Alice challenges Bob to an addition duel. She asks Bob for 5 six-digit numbers. Bob replies with these numbers: 275,381 ; 463,128 ; 978,425, but then Alice interrupts Bob and says, ‘You’re taking too long, I’m going to choose the last two numbers.’ Alice then chooses the numbers 724,618 and 536,871.  

Alice says, ‘The first person to find the sum of these five numbers, without using a calculator, is the winner.’  

They both line up the numbers in a column and then start adding at the same time. Alice gets the correct answer in 2 seconds – how did she do this?

* [ ] She has superhuman powers
* [ ] Her trick involved squaring and then square rooting
* [x] Her trick depended on the number 9
* [ ] Her trick depended on the number 5
* [ ] Her trick depended on using base 2

^^^ hint id=1_1 marks=1
Alice chooses her numbers AFTER Bob, so she is picking numbers that somehow make it easier to add up all five numbers. Maybe each of Alice’s numbers pairs up with one of Bob’s numbers to make something easy to deal with?

Alice chooses her numbers AFTER Bob, so she is picking numbers that somehow make it easier to add up all five numbers. Maybe each of Alice’s numbers pairs up with one of Bob’s numbers to make something easy to deal with?  

Alice’s first number adds to Bob’s first number to make 999,999 and her second number adds to Bob’s second number to also make 999,999. This is easy to do, because you just need to make sure that each pair of digits adds to 9. If Bob picks 123,456, then you pick 876,543, because 1 + 8 = 9, 2 + 7 = 9, and so on.  

Now the sum is easy. It is 999,999 + 999,999 + Bob’s final number, which is 978,425.  

Or, to make it really easy, the sum is 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 978,425 – 2.

## 2. Sounds That Could Exist, But Don't

This video from Tom Scott is all about the language sounds that could exist, but don't. There is no solid connection with mathematics, but it is a fascinating video. It really made me think about the sounds we make with our mouths... and the sounds we don’t or can’t make.

__3.1__ ![](/resources/10-19-tongue-twisters/3-triangles.png){image align="right"}  
The diagram shows four equilateral triangles with sides of length 1, 2, 3 and 4.  

The area of the shaded region is equal to `n` times the area of the unshaded triangle of side-length 1.  

What is the value of n?

^^^ hint id=3_1 marks=2
If one triangle is similar to and has twice the lengths of another triangle, then it has four times the area. This should allow you to quickly work out the areas of the different triangles, but be careful to take into account that 1 bit of each triangle is unshaded.
^^^

---
We suppose that the equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 has area `a`. Because the areas of similar figures are proportional to the squares of their side lengths, it follows that the equilateral triangles with side lengths 2, 3 and 4, have areas `4a`, `9a` and `16a`, respectively.  

It follows that the areas of the parts of these triangles that are shaded are `4a − a`, `9a − a` and `16a − a`, that is, `3a`, `8a` and `15a`, respectively.  

Therefore, the total shaded area is `3a + 8a + 15a = 26a`. Hence `n = 26`.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ The product of two positive integers is equal to twice their sum. This product is also equal to six times the difference between the two integers.  

What is the sum of these two integers?

This is not really the way you should approach the problem, but if you are really stuck, then remember that it is multiple choice. Can you exclude any of the possible answers and take an educated guess?  

Of course, it is much better to actually use algebra to get to the full solution.
^^^

---
We let the two positive integers be `m` and `n`, with `m ≥ n`.  

From the information in the question we deduce that `mn = 2(m + n)` and `mn = 6(m − n)`.  

It follows that `6(m − n) = 2(m + n)`.  

Hence `6m − 6n = 2m + 2n`.  

It follows that `4m = 8n`, and therefore `m = 2n`.  

Substituting `2n` for `m` in the equation `mn` = `2(m + n)`, gives `2n^2 = 6n`.  

Because `n ≠ 0`, we can divide both sides of this last equation by `2n` to deduce that `n = 3`.  

Therefore `m = 6`.  

Hence `m + n = 6 + 3 = 9`.  

Therefore the sum of the two integers is 9.

__5.1__ The diagram shows two rectangles and a regular pentagon.  

One side of each rectangle has been extended to meet at `X`.  

What is the value of `x`?

Regular or irregular, the internal angles of a polygon add up to (n – 2) x 180°, where n is the number of sides.
^^^

^^^ hint id=5_2 marks=2
If you are stuck, just try a brute force approach and try calculating a few values for increasing values of n. You will notice that many of the terms under the square root cancel out.

There are various approaches, and here is one of them.

We use the fact that the sum of the angles of a pentagon is 540°. Hence, each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108°. We also know that the interior angles of the rectangles are each 90°.  

We now consider the pentagon `TUVWX`, as shown in the figure. The interior angles of this polygon at `T` and `W` are each 90°. The interior angle at `U` is the interior angle of the regular polygon, namely 108°. The interior angle at `V` is the sum of an interior angle of the regular pentagon and a right angle, that is, 108° + 90°.  

Therefore `90 + 108 + (108 + 90) + 90 + x = 540`. Hence, `x + 486 = 540`. Therefore `x = 540 − 486 = 54`.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=4
__6.1__ A water tank is `5/6` full. When 30 litres of water are removed from the tank, the tank is `4/5` full.  

How much water does the tank hold when full?

* [ ] 180 litres
* [ ] 360 litres
* [ ] 540 litres
* [ ] 720 litres
* [x] 900 litres
{.col-3}

---
The 30 litres of water removed from the tank is the difference between `5/6` and `4/5` of the capacity of the tank. Now  

`5/6 − 4/5 = (5 × 5 − 4 × 6)/(5 × 6) = (25 − 24)/30 = 1/30`.  

We therefore see that 30 litres amounts to `1/30` of the capacity of the tank. It follows that when the tank is full the number of litres that it holds is `30 × 30 = 900`.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=5
__7.1__ `PQRS` is a square. Point `T` lies on `PQ` so that `PT` : `TQ = 1` : `2`. Point `U` lies on `SR` so that `SU` : `UR = 1` : `2`. The perimeter of `PTUS` is 40 cm.  

What is the area of `PTUS`?

* [ ] 40 cm<sup>2</sup>

Because `PQRS` is a square, `SR = PQ` and `PS = PQ`. Because the ratio `PT` : `TQ` is 1 : 2, we deduce that `PT = 1/3 PQ`. Similarly, we have `SU = 1/3 SR = 1/3 PQ = PT`.  

The lines `PT` and `SU` are parts of opposite sides of the square `PQRS`. Therefore they are parallel. Because they are also of equal length, it follows that `PTUS` is a parallelogram. Therefore `TU = PS = PQ`.  

It follows that the perimeter of `PTUS` is `PT + TU + US + SP = 1/3 PQ + PQ + 1/3 PQ + PQ = 8/3 PQ`. Therefore `8/3 PQ = 40` cm. Hence `PQ = 3/8 × 40` cm `= 15` cm. Therefore `PT = 1/3 × 15` cm `= 5` cm.  

We also note that, because `∠SPT = ∠PSU = 90°`, we can deduce that `PTUS` is a rectangle.  

It follows that the area of PTUS is given by `PT × TU = 5` cm `× 15` cm `= 75` cm<sup>2</sup>.
