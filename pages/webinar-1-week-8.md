# Parallel Academy Module 1 Week 7 Assignment

These problems relate to a recent theme you have been covering during webinars. They are arranged in order of increasing difficulty and the final problem is much more of a challenge than the rest.  

The problems are designed to help you reflect on material from previous webinar sessions (which you can access on your Academy page).  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if you’ve given the problem some real thought.   

Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. Please remember that completing homework is certainly not a race!  

**For questions where you need to type in the answer, unless otherwise specified you may assume the answer is a whole number, and you should only enter the number itself.**  

You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck (particularly with the final problem).

## 1.
::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
How many numbers are in the list 1, 2, 3, ..., 765?   

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 763
* [ ] 764
* [x] 765
* [ ] 766
{.col-5}

765

## 2.
::: problem id=2_1 marks=2 
How many numbers are in the list 123, 124, 125, ..., 456?   

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 333
* [x] 334
* [ ] 335
* [ ] 336
{.col-5}

---

456 − 123 + 1 = 334  

Alternatively, subtracting 122 from each of the numbers in the list gives the new list 1, 2, 3, ..., 334 and this list clearly consists of 334 numbers. 
:::



## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
How many numbers are in the list −150, −149, −148, ..., 55?     

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 205
* [x] 206
* [ ] 207
{.col-5}

---

55 − −150 + 1 = 206

Alternatively, adding 151 to each of the numbers in the list gives the new list 1, 2, 3, ..., 206 and this list clearly consists of 206 numbers. 
:::



## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
If `a` is a positive integer, how many positive integers are in the list below (in terms of `a`)?  

`a`, `a + 1`, `a + 2`, ..., `5a − 1`, `5a`  

* [ ] `4a`
* [x] `4a + 1`
* [ ] `4a - 1`
* [ ] `6a`
* [ ] `6a + 1`
{.col-5}

---

`5a − a + 1 = 4a + 1`  

Alternatively, subtracting `a − 1` from each of the numbers in the list gives the new list 1, 2, 3, ..., `4a + 1` and this list clearly consists of `4a + 1` numbers.  
:::



## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
How many multiples of 15 are there between 1000 and 9000 inclusive?     

* [ ] 535
* [x] 534
* [ ] 533
* [ ] 532
* [ ] 531
{.col-5}

---

Writing them as a list we have 1005, 1020, 1035, ...,  9960, 9975, 9000.  

This means that after the first number in the list, there must be `(9000 − 1005)/15` = 533 numbers in the list.  

If we include the first number in the list, we must have 534 numbers in the list and so there are 534 multiples of 15 between 1000 and 9000 inclusive.

Alice writes down a list of 245 consecutive positive integers.  

For her list she calculates how many of the numbers are multiples of 8.  

What are the only possibilities for the answer she could have got?  

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 31
* [ ] 29 or 30
* [x] 30 or 31
* [ ] 29 or 30 or 31
{.col-5}

---

245 = 30 × 8 + 5, and so the list of numbers can be broken down into thirty smaller lists of eight consecutive numbers and a final list consisting of the last five numbers.  

Each smaller list of eight consecutive numbers will have one multiple of 8 and the final list can have one or none.  

This means the only possibilities for the number of multiples of 8 are 30 or 31.
