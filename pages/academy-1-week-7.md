# Parallel Academy Module 1 Week 5 Assignment

**Unlike previous assignments, this assignment relates to all the topics covered in the first five weeks of Tutorials. You will find it helpful to look at all previous session materials.**

The problems are designed to help you reflect on material from previous tutorial sessions (which you can access on your Academy page).  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if youâ€™ve given the problem some real thought.   

Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. Please remember that completing homework is certainly not a race!  

You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck (particularly with the final problem).  

We will also be running a weekly homework review session (look out for our emails).  

**Before you click Submit at the end of the assignment, check that all of your answers have been entered correctly.**
