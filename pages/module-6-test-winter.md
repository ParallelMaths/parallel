## 1.	
::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the highest common factor of 84 and 126?

<input type="number" solution="42"/>  

---

84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.  
126 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 7.  

So the highest common factor is 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/2-quadrilateral.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="48"/>  

---

Angles in a quadrilateral sum to 360°, so a = 360 – (117 + 99 + 96) = 48. 
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 5:3 and there are 15 girls, how many students are there altogether?

* [ ] 20
* [ ] 25
* [ ] 30
* [ ] 35
* [x] 40
{.col-5}

---

15 girls represent `3/(3+5) = 3/8` of the total number of students.  

So the total number of students is `8/3 × 15 = 40`.

## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is prime?

* [ ] 111
* [x] 113
* [ ] 115
* [ ] 117
* [ ] 119
{.col-5}

---

* 111 = 3 × 37
* 113 is prime  
* 115 = 5 × 23
* 117 = 9 × 13
* 119 = 7 × 17

## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
What is the value of each interior angle of a regular octagon, in degrees?

<input type="number" solution="135"/>  

---

The general formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is:  

180° × `(n − 2)/n`  

For an octagon, we plug in `n = 8` to get an interior angle of:  

180° × `6/8` = 180° × `3/4` = 135°
:::


## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is largest?

* [ ] `3^4`
* [x] `2^7`
* [ ] `8^2`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `9^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are  

* `3^4 = 81`
* `2^7 = 128`
* `8^2 = 64`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `9^2 = 81`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What number must be added to the set {3, 4, 5, 6} to give a mean of 6?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 10
* [x] 12
{.col-5}

---

The total of all the numbers will be 5 × 6 = 30.  

So the missing number is 30 - (3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 12.
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability that you get the same outcome all three times?

* [ ] `1/8`
* [x] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `3/4`
* [ ] `1`
{.col-5}

---

There are two ways this could happen: three Heads or three Tails.  

p(3 Heads) = `1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`.  

Similarly, p(3 Tails) = `1/8`.  

So the probability of getting either of these outcomes is `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`.  
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
Which of these is not divisible by 9?

* [ ] 12 × 36
* [ ] 18 × 24
* [x] 33 × 35
* [ ] 54 × 21
* [ ] 15 × 39
{.col-5}

---

For 12 × 36, 18 × 24, 54 × 21 and 15 × 39, each term of the product has a factor of 3, so the product is divisible by 9.  

33 × 35 only has one factor of 3, and is not divisible by 9.  
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
How many ways are there to arrange the four integers 1, 2, 3 and 4 so that no two adjacent numbers have the same parity?  

(Two number have the same parity if they are both odd or both even)  

<input type="number" solution="8"/>  

---

We have four choices for the first number.  

Once that is chosen, then whichever number shares its parity must go into the third position.  

To see this, first note that it can’t go into the second position because adjacent numbers must have a different parity. It also can’t go in the fourth position because that would leave the remaining two numbers next to each other and they have the same parity.  

So the only remaining choice is which way around to put those remaining two numbers in the second and fourth place. There are two such ways.  

To recap, we have two choices:  

* Which number to place in the first position (__4 ways__)  
* Which way around to place the two numbers that do not share the first number’s parity in the second and fourth position (__2 ways__)  

This leaves a total of 4 × 2 = 8 possible combinations.

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/11-quarter-circle.png){image align="right"}
The radius of the grey circle is 1. What is the radius of the quarter-circle?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 2 + √2
* [ ] 2√2+1
* [x] 1 + √2
* [ ] √2

---

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/11-quarter-circle-solution.png){image align="right"}
The red line is the radius of the quarter circle.  

It can be split into two parts: the radius of the grey circle, which is 1, and a slightly longer segment.  

The slightly longer segment is the diagonal of a square whose side length equals the radius of the grey circle.  

By Pythagoras the longer segment has length √2.  

So the total length of the red line is 1 + √2.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
The sum of the nine digits of the number `aaaabbbbb` is equal to the two-digit number ‘`ab`’.  

What is the ratio of `a` to `b`?

* [ ] 1:1
* [ ] 1:2
* [x] 2:3
* [ ] 3:4
* [ ] 4:5
{.col-5}

---

The number ‘`ab`’ can be written as `10a + b`, giving the equation.  

`4a + 5b = 10a + b`.  

This can be simplified to `4b = 6a`.  

Thus `a/b = 4/6 = 2/3`, so a:b = 2:3.  
:::


## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
Which of these is equal to `19^2 + 20^2 + 21^2 + 22^2`?
 
* [x] 1686
* [ ] 1687
* [ ] 1688
* [ ] 1689
* [ ] 1690
{.col-5}

---

Rather than compute the values brute force, just consider the Ones digit.  

The four terms give a Ones digit, respectively, of 1, 0, 1, 4.  

So the sum of the four terms must give a Ones digit of 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6, which only 1686 agrees with.  
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
Peter drives from A to B at an average speed of 20 mph.  

His drive back from B to A is at an average speed of 25 mph and takes 6 minutes less.  

How far in miles, is it from A to B?  

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [x] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
{.col-5}

---

Let `x` be the number of miles from A to B. It takes Peter `x/20` hours to drive from A to B at 20 mph and `x/25` to drive from B to A at 25 mph.  

The difference in the time taken for these two legs of the journey is 6 minutes, or `1/10` hours.  

Therefore `1/10 = x/20 − x/25 = 1/100 x`.

Solve this equation to get `x = 100/10 = 10` miles.

## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/15-heart.jpg){image align="right"}
The diagram shows four overlapping hearts.  

The areas of the hearts are 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, 4 cm<sup>2</sup>, 9 cm<sup>2</sup>, and 16 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

What is the total shaded area?

* [ ] 9 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 10 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 11 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 12 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 13 cm<sup>2</sup>

---

Since the areas of the four hearts are 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, 4 cm<sup>2</sup>, 9 cm<sup>2</sup>, and 16 cm<sup>2</sup>, the outer and inner shaded regions have areas 16cm<sup>2</sup> - 9 cm<sup>2</sup> = 7 cm<sup>2</sup>, and 4 cm<sup>2</sup> - 1 cm<sup>2</sup> = 3 cm<sup>2</sup> respectively.  

Therefore the total shaded area is 7 cm<sup>2</sup> + 3 cm<sup>2</sup> = 10 cm<sup>2</sup>.

## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/16-town-signs.jpg){image align="right"}
The shortest path from Atown to Cetown runs through Betown.  

The two signposts shown are set up at different places along this path.  

What distance is written on the broken sign?

* [x] 1 km
* [ ] 3 km
* [ ] 4 km
* [ ] 5 km
* [ ] 9 km
{.col-5}

---

The information on the signs pointing to Atown and the signs pointing to Cetown both tell us that the distance between signs is:  

(7 - 2) km = (9 - 4) km = 5 km.  

Therefore the distance which is written on the broken sign is (5 - 4) km = 1 km.  
:::


## 17.
::: problem id=17_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/17-garden.jpg){image align="right"}
Sacha's garden has the shape shown.  

All the sides are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  

Some of the dimensions are shown in the diagram.  

What is the length of the perimeter of Sacha's garden?  

* [ ] 22
* [ ] 23
* [x] 24
* [ ] 25
* [ ] 26
{.col-5}

---

Divide the garden up and let the lenghts of the various sides be as shown on the diagram.  

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/17-garden-solution.jpg){image align="center"}

Since all sides are either parallel or perpendicular, `a + b + c = 3`.  

Therefore the perimeter of Sacha's garden is `3 + 5 + a + x + b + 4 + c + (4 + (5 - x)) = 21 + a + b + c = 24`.  
:::


## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
The mean score of the students who took a mathematics test was 6.  

Exactly 60% of the students passed the test.  

The mean score of the students who passed the test was 8.  

What was the mean score of the students who failed the test?  

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

Let the mean score of the 40% of the students who failed the test be `x`.  

The information in the question tells us that `0.6 × 8 + 0.4 × x = 6`.  

Hence `0.4x = 1.2` and so `x = 3`.
:::


## 19.
::: problem id=19_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/19-grid.jpg){image align="right"}
James wrote a different integer from 1 to 9 in each cell of a table.  

He then calculated the sum of the integers in each of the rows and in each of the columns of the table.  

Five of his answers were 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17, in some order.  

What is his sixth answer?

* [x] 17
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 13
{.col-5}

---

The total of the sums of the three rows of the table is equal to the sum of all the digits from 1 to 9, which is 45.  

Similarly, the total of the sums of the three columns of the table is also equal to 45.  

Hence James' six answers add to 45 + 45 = 90.  

The sum of the five answers given is 12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 73 and hence his sixth answer is 90 - 73 = 17.  

_It is left as an exercise to find a possible arrangement of the digits 1 to 9 that actually gives these six sums._

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/20-cube.jpg){image align="right"}
The cube shown is divided into 64 small cubes.  

Exactly one of the cubes is grey, as shown in the diagram.  

Two cubes are said to be 'neighbours' if they have a common face.  

On the first day, the white neighbours of the grey cube are changed to grey.   

On the second day, the white neighbours of all the grey cubes are changed to grey.  

How many grey cubes are there at the end of the second day?

* [ ] 11
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 16
* [x] 17
{.col-5}

---

The diagram below shows the day on which certain cubes turned grey. 

![](/resources/module-6-test-winter/20-cube-solution.jpg){image align="center"}  

As can be seen, at the end of the second day there are 11 + 5 + 1 = 17 grey cubes.
