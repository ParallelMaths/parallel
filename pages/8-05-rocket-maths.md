## 1. What is zero factorial?

Have you covered factorials? If not, here is brief introduction.

The factorial of a number is the result of multiplying that particular number by all the numbers smaller than it, all the way down to 1.

For example, (4 factorial) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

Instead of writing _“factorial”_, we write _“!”_.

For example, 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720.

But, how do you begin to work out the value of 0! ?

This video explores the meaning and value of 0!.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ Choose the value of 0!

* [ ] -1
* [ ] 0
* [x] 1
* [ ] 2

---

The video explains why 0! = 1.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ What the value of 5! ?

<input type="number" solution="120"/>

---

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3.__ Use a calculator to work out 10!

<input type="number" solution="3,628,800"/>

---

10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800

You can work this out by typing each number into your calculator one by one, or you can type 10 and then press the “!” button.

::: problem id=1_4 marks=3
__1.4.__ How many ways can you arrange 7 different objects?

<input type="number" solution="5,040"/>

---

7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040

The video explains that the number of ways to arrange _n_ objects is the same as _n!_.

## 2.	October Sky

“October Sky” is a Hollywood film based on the true story of Homer H. Hickam, Jr., a coal miner's son who took up rocketry against his father's wishes and eventually became a NASA engineer.

In this clip, Homer’s headteacher thinks that one of his rockets caused a fire, but Homer uses maths (and physics) to explain that his rocket could not have been responsible.

Homer writes an equation on the blackboard:

__s = ½ × a × t<sup>2</sup>__

Crudely, this equation tells you the distance an object falls under the influence of gravity during a given time. This is how you read the equation:

*	_“s”_ is the distance in metres, because the Latin word for space (or distance) is 'spatium'.
*	_“a”_ is the acceleration due to gravity and has a value of 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> (although it has a different value in the film, because Americans use different units).  
*	_“t”_ is the time in seconds.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ If an object is dropped from a cliff edge, how far will it fall in 4 seconds?

* [ ] 4 m
* [ ] 16 m
* [x] 80 m
* [ ] 20 m
* [ ] 160 m

---

s = ½ × a × t<sup>2</sup> = ½ × 10 × 4<sup>2</sup> = 80 m
:::

If a = 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>, then we can simplify the equation:

s = ½ × a × t<sup>2</sup> = ½ × 10 × t<sup>2</sup> = 5 × t<sup>2</sup>

::: problem id=2_2 marks=3
__2.2__ If an object is dropped from a cliff edge, how long will it take to fall 20 m?  

* [x] 2 s
* [ ] 4 s
* [ ] 10 s
* [ ] 100 s

---

There are 2 ways to solve this problem.

1. Plug numbers into the basic question and solve it:

`s = 5 × t`<sup>2</sup>  
=> `20 = 5× t`<sup>2</sup>

2.	Re-arrange the equation, so that t is the subject of the equation:

`t = √(s/5)`    
=> `t = √(20/5)`  
=> `t = √4 = 2` seconds.

__2.3__ What caused the fire?

## 3.	Junior Maths Challenge Problem
<!--- (2013) Q14.1 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ How many different possibilities are there for the side lengths of an isosceles triangle each of whose sides is a whole number of centimetres and whose perimeter is 24 cm?

* [ ] 3
* [x] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 11

---

A bit of trial and error suggests that triangles with these sides are okay:

* (7, 7, 10)
* (8, 8, 8)
* (9, 9, 6)
* (10, 10, 4)
* (11, 11, 2)

So the answer is 5 isosceles triangles are possible.

(6, 6, 12) is not possible, because all three points would be on a line.  

(5, 5, 14) is not possible because the two short sides will not connect to the long side.  

And, of course, (12, 12, 0) is not possible.
