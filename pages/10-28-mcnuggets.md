__1.2__ True or false? If you cannot make a number of nuggets from a combination of 6, 9 & 20 nuggets, then that number must be prime.

* [ ] True
* [x] False

For example, you cannot make 4 nuggets from 6, 9 & 20, but 4 is not prime.

For example, you can make 29 nuggets from 6, 9 & 20, because 20 + 9 = 29, and 29 is prime.

__3.1__ Ten stones, of identical shape and size, are used to make an arch, as shown in the diagram.  

Each stone has a cross section in the shape of a trapezium with three equal sides.  

What is the size of the smallest angles of the trapezium?

Let `ABCD` be the cross-section of one of the stones, as shown.  

As `AD = BC`, `ABCD` is an isosceles trapezium with `∠ADC = ∠BCD`.  

If `∠ADC = ∠BCD = θ`, then `2θ` is the interior angle of a regular 20-sided polygon, namely `(180 - 360/20)°`, which equals `162°`.  

So `θ` is `81°`.

__4.1__ This regular hexagon has been divided into four trapezia and one hexagon.  

If each of the five sections has the same perimeter, what is the ratio of the lengths p, q and r ?

Each exterior angle of a regular hexagon = 360° ÷ 6 = 60°, so when sides HB and IC are extended to meet at A, an equilateral triangle, ABC, is created.  

Let the sides of this triangle be of length x. As BC, DE and FG are all parallel, triangles ABC, ADE and AFG are all equilateral. So `DE = DA = p + x`; `FG = FA = q + p + x`.

Each exterior angle of a regular hexagon = 360° ÷ 6 = 60°, so when sides HB and IC are extended to meet at A, an equilateral triangle, ABC, is created.  

Let the sides of this triangle be of length x. As BC, DE and FG are all parallel, triangles ABC, ADE and AFG are all equilateral. So `DE = DA = p + x`; `FG = FA = q + p + x`.

The perimeter of trapezium `BCED = x + p + x + 2p = 2x + 3p`; the perimeter of trapezium `DEGF = (p + x) + (q + p + x) + 2q = 2x + 2p + 3q`; the perimeter of hexagon `FGIKJH = 2((q + p + x) + 2r) = 2x + 2p + 2q + 4r`.  

So `2x + 3p = 2x + 2p + 3q`; hence `p = 3q`. Also `2x + 2p + 3q = 2x + 2p + 2q + 4r`; hence `q = 4r`.  

So `p : q : r = 12r : 4r : r = 12 : 4 : 1`.

## 5. Professor Wiseman’s puzzles

Another puzzle from Professor Wiseman, [whose website is worth a visit](https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/){target="_blank"} when you’ve completed this Parallelogram.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=3
__5.1__ There are four suspects and one of them has committed a crime.  They make the following statements, but only one of them is telling the truth.  Who committed the crime?

- Jon: James did it.  
- James: Bob did it.  
- Sid: I didn’t do it.  
- Bob: James is lying.  

* [ ] Jon
* [ ] James
* [x] Sid  
* [ ] Bob
{.col-5}

---

If anyone other than Bob is telling the truth, the other statements produce a contradiction.  

If Sid committed the crime, then he is clearly lying, and so is James (who says Bob did it), and so is Jon (who says James did it). But Bob is telling the truth, because James is indeed lying.  

Everything is compatible with the question, which says there is only one criminal and one liar.

Let the sizes of the interior angles of the quadrilateral in the centre of the figure be `a`°, `b`°, `c`° and `d`°. Then `a + b + c + d = 360`°.  

Each of these angles is vertically opposite to one of the unmarked angles in the four triangles, as shown. So the sum of the marked angles plus the four angles of the quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the interior angles of four triangles, that is 720°.  

Hence the sum of the marked angles is 720° − 360° = 360°.
