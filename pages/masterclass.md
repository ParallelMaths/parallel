# Maths Masterclass

As part of our Maths Masterclass sessions, students are required to take part in our weekly Parallel maths puzzles.

Getting started with Parallel is very easy to do, and only takes a few minutes. Simply [visit our sign up page](https://parallel.org.uk/signup) and:
1.	Enter your first name
2.	Where asked to add your surname, instead input your MATHS MASTERCLASS ID (You should find this in an email from [maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk](mailto:maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk))
3.	Enter your email address
4.	Enter your password. Make sure it is a password you can remember – perhaps make a note of it somewhere.
5.	In the field marked “Teacher code”, enter the Maths Masterclass code: **n4zjt4**  
6.	Select your school year, and your year of birth
7.	Tick the box to say you have read our Data Protection Terms and Conditions
8.	Hit Sign-Up to finalise your sign up.

That’s all there is to it!

Each week, you will be asked to complete the next parallelogram. Ask your tutor if you’re not sure which parallelogram you should be completing. Students whose email accounts allow for external emails will receive a weekly email reminder whenever a new Parallel is released.


## What if you already have a personal Parallel account?

If you are already a Parallel user, you’ll just need to update your account. Simply [go to your Edit Account page](https://parallel.org.uk/account), and:

1.	Change your surname to your MATHS MASTERCLASS ID
2.	In the field marked “Teacher code”, enter the Maths Masterclass code: **n4zjt4**  


## What if you are already a Parallel user at school?

Some schools have already been using Parallel for some time, and so you may have already been given a different Teacher Code, so your class teacher can keep track of your progress. If so, we would like all students in Year 10 to email a screenshot of your score each week to [maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk](mailto:maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk), so we can see how you are doing.
