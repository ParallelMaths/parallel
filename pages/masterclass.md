# Maths Masterclass

As part of the Maths Masterclass sessions, students in Years 8-10 are required to take part in our weekly Parallel maths puzzles. And, students in other years are strongly encouraged to complete the so-called Parallelograms each week.

## What if you don't already have a Parallel account?

Getting started with Parallel is very easy to do, and only takes a few minutes. Simply [visit our sign up page](https://parallel.org.uk/signup) and:
1.	Enter your first name
2.	Where asked to add your surname, instead input your MATHS MASTERCLASS ID (You should find this in an email from [maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk](mailto:maths.masterclasses@talent-ed.uk))
3.	Enter your email address
4.	Enter your password. Make sure it is a password you can remember – perhaps make a note of it somewhere.
5.	In the field marked “Teacher Code”, enter the Maths Masterclass code: **n4zjt4**  
6.	Select your school year, and your year of birth
7.	Tick the box to say you have read our Data Protection Terms and Conditions
8.	Hit Sign-Up to finalise your sign up.

That’s all there is to it!

Each week, you will be asked to complete the next parallelogram. Ask your tutor if you’re not sure which parallelogram you should be completing. Students whose email accounts allow for external emails will receive a weekly email reminder whenever a new Parallel is released.

## What if you already have a personal Parallel account?

If you are already a Parallel user, you’ll just need to update your account. Simply [go to your Edit Account page](https://parallel.org.uk/account), and:

1.	In the field marked “Teacher Code”, enter the Maths Masterclass code: **n4zjt4**  
2.  If (for some reason) you already have a Teacher Code, then please [go to your account page](/account) and add **n4zjt4** as a second Teacher Code

## What if you are already a Parallel user at school?

Some schools have already been using Parallel for some time, so you may have already been given a different Teacher Code, which allows your class teacher to keep track of your progress. If you already have a Teacher Code from your school, then please [go to your account page](/account) and add **n4zjt4**  as a second Teacher Code, so that we can also keep track of your progress.

Please complete the Parallelograms required by your own teacher and in addition complete those set by the Maths Masterclass programme. If the Parallelogram set by the Maths Masterclass programme is one that you have already completed, then we will be able to see this, so you will not need to do it again... indeed you can only complete each Parallelogram once.

Note: please ensure you have read and understood our [Data Protection & Terms and Conditions policy](/privacy-notice) before signing up.
