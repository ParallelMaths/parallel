## 1. An unusual football transfer
<!--- (2003) Q7 --->
::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ A number of years ago, a newspaper reported that Turkish football team Sarigol Municipality transferred four of its players in return for a fee of 225 sacks of cement, needed to repair their stadium. At the same rate of exchange, how many sacks of cement would the transfer fee for a full team of eleven players and one reserve?

* [ ] 233
* [ ] 450
* [x] 675
* [ ] 900
* [ ] 2700
{.col-5}

---

The transfer fee for a total of 12 players would be three times that for 4 players.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__ After a year's training, Minnie increased her average speed in the London Marathon by 25%.  

By what percentage did her time decrease?

* [ ] 50
* [ ] 30
* [x] 20
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=3_1 marks=1
It helps to think about this problem in terms of fractions, rather than percentages. If the new speed is 5/4 of the original speed, then what is the new time?
^^^

---

Minnie's average speed this year is `5/4` of last year's value. Hence her time this year will be `4/5`, ie 80% of last year's time.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
![](/resources/10-41-concrete-transfer/13-pentagon.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.1__ What is the area of the pentagon shown?

* [ ] `1/2a (b - c)`
* [x] `1/2b (a + c)`
* [ ] `1/2a (b + c)`
* [ ] `1/2b (c - a)`
* [ ] `1/2c (a + b)`

---

The area of the pentagon is that of a rectangle of length `b` and breadth `a` plus that of a triangle of base `b` and height `(c - a)`, ie `ab + 1/2 b (c - a) = 1/2 b (2a + c - a) = 1/2 b (a + c)`.  

The area may also be considered to be the sum of the areas of two trapezia which have parallel sides `a` and `c` and whose heights have total length `b`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ The width:height ratio of television screens is changing from the traditional 4:3 to the widescreen 16:9. If a traditional screen and a widescreen have the same area, then what is the ratio widescreen width:traditional width?  

Assume that television screens are rectangles.

* [x] `2 : sqrt(3)`
* [ ] `3 : 2`
* [ ] `3 : sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `4 : 3`
* [ ] none of these
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5_1 marks=2
Let the widescreen width and traditional width be `w` and `W` respectively. Then the respective heights are `(9w)/16` and `3(W)/4`.
^^^

---

As the areas are equal:  

`w × (9w)/16 = W × (3W)/4`, ie `w^2 = 4/3 W^2`. Hence `w` : W = `2 : sqrt(3)`

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
