## 1. Digital Clocks

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ In a 24-hour period, how often does the number 5 appear in a digital clock?  

Let me define the question in a bit more detail. Count how many 5's would be on the clock if you looked at it every minute. So, for example, at 05:53 there are two, then at 05:54 there are two, and at 05:55 there are three and so on. By the way, it is a 24-hour clock, so you will also have 15:55 that has three 5’s.

<input solution="504"/>

^^^ hint id=1_1
The answer is between 500 and 600.

This question appeared on [the NRICH website](https://nrich.maths.org/){target="_blank"}, which has lots of great maths resources.  

In one hour, the 5 appears in the minutes 16 times.  

In 24 hours, the 5 appears in the minutes `24 × 16 = 384` times.  

The 5 appears 60 more times when the hour is `05`.  

The 5 appears 60 more times when the hour is `15`.  

In 24 hours, the 5 appears in the hours `2 × 60 = 120` times.  

Therefore, the total is `384 + 120 = 504` times.

__2.1__ The diagram shows a quadrilateral `PQRS` in which `PQ` and `QR` have the same length.  

Also `PR` bisects `∠SPQ`, the ratio of `∠SPR` to `∠PRS` is `2 : 3` and `∠PSR = 110°`.  

How large is angle `PQR`?

* [x] 124°
* [ ] 120°
* [ ] 110°
* [ ] 90°
* [ ] 28°
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1
Because the angles of a triangle have sum 180° and `∠PSR = 110°`, it follows that `∠SPR + ∠PRS = 180° − 110° = 70°`.  
^^^

^^^ hint id=2_2
The ratio of `∠SPR` to `∠PRS` is `2 : 3`. It follows that `∠SPR = 2/5 × 70° = 28°`.  
^^^

Because the angles of a triangle have sum 180° and `∠PSR = 110°`, it follows that `∠SPR + ∠PRS = 180° − 110° = 70°`.  

The ratio of `∠SPR` to `∠PRS` is `2 : 3`. It follows that `∠SPR = 2/5 × 70° = 28°`.  

Since `PR` bisects `∠SPQ`, we deduce that `∠RPQ = ∠SPR = 28°`.  

Since `PQ = QR`, the triangle `PQR` is isosceles, and therefore `∠PRQ = ∠RPQ = 28°`.  

Thus the triangle `PQR` has two angles which are each `28°`. Therefore, because sum of the angles of a triangle is `180°`, we deduce that:

`∠PQR = 180° − 28° − 28° = 124°`.

## 3. Richard Feynman explains science

Richard Feynman is a hero of science and a Nobel Prize winner in physics. In this video, he explains how being a scientist is like watch a game of chess when you don’t understand the rules.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ In the triangles `PQR` and `STU`, `∠RPQ = 2 × ∠UST`, `∠PRQ = 2 × ∠SUT` and `∠RQP = 1/5 × ∠UTS`.  

How large is `∠UTS`?

* [ ] 90°
* [x] 100°
* [ ] 120°
* [ ] 150°
* [ ] more information needed

^^^ hint id=4_1
Let the angles of the triangle `STU` be `s°`, `t°` and `u°` as shown in the figure.

![](/resources/8-32-rules-critical-thinking/4-triangles.png){image align="center"}
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_2
The angles of a triangle have sum 180°. Therefore

`s + t + u = 180` (1) and  
`2s + (1/5)t + 2u = 180`. (2)  
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_3
By multiplying equation (1) by 2 we obtain  

`2s + 2t + 2u = 360`. (3)  

Then, by subtracting equation (2) from equation (3), we deduce that

`(2 − 1/5)t = 180`

Let the angles of the triangle `STU` be `s°`, `t°` and `u°` as shown in the figure.

![](/resources/8-32-rules-critical-thinking/4-triangles.png){image align="center"}

It follows that the angles of the triangle `PQR` are `2s°`, `1/5t°` and `2u°`, as shown.  

The angles of a triangle have sum 180°. Therefore

`s + t + u = 180` (1) and  
`2s + (1/5)t + 2u = 180`. (2)  

By multiplying equation (1) by 2 we obtain  

`2s + 2t + 2u = 360`. (3)  

Then, by subtracting equation (2) from equation (3), we deduce that

`(2 − 1/5)t = 180`,  

that is,  

`9/5t = 180`.  

Therefore  

`t = 5/9 × 180 = 100`.  

It follows that `∠UTS = 100`.

## 5. Bertrand Russell’s rules for critical thinking

Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a British philosopher and mathematician. He compiled 10 rules for critical thinking (which is the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding the logical connection between ideas). In his words: _“The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate (promote).”_

I want you to think about each one in detail, so here are the first five … the next five will appear next week.

![](/resources/8-32-rules-critical-thinking/5-bertrand-russell.jpg){image align="right"}
_1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.  
2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.  
3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.  
4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.  
5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found._

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
