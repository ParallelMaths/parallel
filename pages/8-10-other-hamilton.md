## 1. Drew’s puzzle #1

Here is the first of two puzzles via maths specialist teacher and former headteacher Drew Foster (@drewfoster0 on Twitter). If you can’t solve them, blame him, not me.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=5
__1.1__ This is a tough problem, which is why it is worth so many marks. What is the value of A?

![](/resources/8-10-other-hamilton/1-puzzle-question.jpg){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="3"/>

^^^ hint id=1
(A + A = B), and there is no carry, as there is no fourth digit in the answer to the sum, so A must be 1, 2 , 3 or 4.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2
At first sight, (C + C = A) and (B + C = A) for the middle and right columns, but B and C are different. This can only be possible if (B + C) is bigger than 10, so there is a carry into the middle column, so (C + C + 1 = A). This means (B + C = 11, 12, 13 or 14), in order to have a carry over.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3
We know that (C + C + 1 = B + C = A). So, B is equal to (C + 1).  And we know (B + C = 11, 12, 13 or 14). So we have B = 6, C = 5 … or B = 7, C = 6).

(A + A = B), and there is no carry, as there is no fourth digit in the answer to the sum, so A must be 1, 2 , 3 or 4.

At first sight, (C + C = A) and (B + C = A) for the middle and right columns, but B and C are different. This can only be possible if (B + C) is bigger than 10, so there is a carry into the middle column, so (C + C + 1 = A). This means (B + C = 11, 12, 13 or 14), in order to have a carry over.

We know that (C + C + 1 = B + C = A). So, B is equal to (C + 1).  And we know (B + C = 11, 12, 13 or 14). So we have B = 6, C = 5 … or B = 7, C = 6).

From here, we can use trial and error to deduce that A = 3.

## 2.	Drew’s puzzle #2

A 5 x 5 x 5 cube consisting of 125 smaller cubes (known as cubelets) is completely painted.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
__2.1__ How many cubelets have 4 faces painted yellow?

<input type="number" solution="0"/>

---

None of the smaller cubes have more than 3 faces showing.
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=1
__2.2__ How many cubelets have 3 faces painted yellow?

<input type="number" solution="8"/>

---

Only the 8 corner cubelets (4 at the top, and 4 at the bottom) have 3 yellow faces.
:::

::: problem id=2_3 marks=2
__2.3__ How many cubelets have 2 faces painted yellow?

<input type="number" solution="36"/>

---

The edge cubelets have two yellow faces. There are three cubelets per edge, and twelve edges, and 3 × 12 = 36.
:::

::: problem id=2_4 marks=2
__2.4__ How many cubelets have 1 faces painted yellow?

<input type="number" solution="54"/>

---

The face cubelets have one yellow face. There are (3 × 3 = 9) cubelets per face, and six faces. So the answer is 9 × 6 = 54.

Another way to arrive at this answer is that the big cube has 6 big faces. There are 25 small yellow faces per big face, so 6 × 25 = 150 small yellow faces in total.

Earlier, we calculated:  
* 8 cubelets have 3 yellow faces = 24 small yellow faces.  
* 36 cubelets have 2 yellow faces = 72 small yellow faces.  

The number cubelets with 1 yellow face must be 150 – 24 – 72 = 54.
:::

::: problem id=2_5 marks=1
__2.5__ How many cubelets have 0 faces painted yellow?

<input type="number" solution="27"/>

---

Inside the big cube we can imagine a 3 × 3 × 3 cube with no faces exposed to the outside. And 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.  

Alternatively, the 5 × 5 × 5 cube consists of 125 cubelets. Our previous answers have counted 8, 36 and 54 cubelets with at least one yellow face, so the number of remaining unpainted cubelets must be (125 – 8 – 36 – 54 = 27).

## 3. William Rowan Hamilton

The biggest theatre show in recent years to hit New York is a musical called “Hamilton”. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States of America, and the man responsible for setting up the American banking system. Many of the songs involve rap.  

It is incredible that someone (the brilliant Lin-Manuel Miranda) was able to create a hit show based on the life of a long-dead politician, whose life story was unknown to many Americans.  

Anyway, what this got to do with maths? Tim Blais has a created a song and video based on the opening song from “Hamilton” – it is not about American politician Alexander Hamilton, but rather it is about the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. Watch the video and answer the two questions below.

## 4.	Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2014) Q17 --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
![](/resources/8-10-other-hamilton/4-map-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.1__ The diagram is a “map” of Jo’s local rail network, where the dots represent stations and the lines are routes. Jo wants to visit all the stations, travelling only by train, starting at any station and ending at any station, with no restrictions on which routes are taken.  

What is the smallest number of stations that Jo must go to more than once?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5

---
![](/resources/8-10-other-hamilton/4-map-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
We label the stations as shown in the diagram on the right so that we can refer to them. Jo can visit the stations in the order:

`O, P, Q, R, S, R, T, X, Y, Z, Y, X, W, V, U`

In this way she visits all the stations and goes through just three of them, R, Y and X more than once.

It remains only to show that Jo cannot visit all the stations without going through at least three of them more than once.

Jo must go through the junction stations R and X more than once. If Jo does not start or finish at `O`, she will have to go through `P` more than once. If she does not start or finish at `U` she will have to go through `V` more than once. If she starts at `O` and finishes at `U`, or vice versa, she will have to go through `Y` more than once. It follows that Jo has to go through at least three stations more than once.  

So this is the smallest number of stations Jo must go through more than once.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
