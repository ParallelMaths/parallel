## 2. Probability puzzle

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ It’s dark. Your sock drawer contains 10 white socks and 10 black socks. You take out one sock, but you don’t know what colour it is. You take out a second sock – what is the probability that the second sock is white?  

Write down your probability as a decimal, accurate to one decimal place.

<input solution="0.5"/>

^^^ hint id=2_1 marks=1
The first sock is equally likely to be black or white.
^^^

---

Because the first sock could have been black or white, with equal probability, then it has no real impact on working out the probability of the second.  

If the first sock was black, then the chance of picking a white sock would be 10/19. If the first sock was white, then the chance of picking a white sock would be 9/19. But we don’t know whether the first sock is black or white, so we take the average, which is 9.5/19 = ½.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ The angles of a quadrilateral are in the ratio 3 : 4 : 5 : 6.  

What is the difference between the largest angle and the smallest angle?

* [ ] 30°
* [ ] 40°
* [ ] 50°
* [x] 60°
* [ ] 70°
{.col-5}

Because the angles are in the ratio 3 : 4 : 5 : 6, and 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18, the largest angle makes up `6/18`, that is, `1/3` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral. Similarly, the smallest angle makes up `3/18`, that is, `1/6` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral.  

It follows that the difference between the largest and the smallest angle is `1/3 − 1/6`, that is, `1/6` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral.  

The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is `360°`. It follows that the difference between the largest angle and the smallest angle of the quadrilateral is  

`1/6 × 360° = 60°`.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
![](/resources/10-15-optical-illusions/4-shape.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.1__ The diagram shows a quadrilateral `PQRS` made from two similar right-angled triangles, `PQR` and `PRS`.  

The length `PQ` is 3, the length `QR` is 4 and `∠PRQ = ∠PSR`.  

What is the perimeter of `PQRS`?

* [x] 22
* [ ] 22 5/6
* [ ] 27
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 45 1/3

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=2
It’s easy to work out PR. Then you can try two approaches.

(1)	Work out the perimeter of the small triangle. Then you know the perimeter of the large triangle is 5/3 bigger, as QP corresponds to PR in the two similar triangles. So you can work out the perimeter of the small triangle plus the big triangle, but you have to subtract the lengths of the two common sides, which are not part of the perimeter of the quadrilateral.

(2)	The longer way is to work out each of the lengths one by one, using the ratio 5/3 and Pythagoras' theorem.
^^^

---

Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the right-angled triangle `PQR` gives `RP^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25`. Therefore `RP` has length 5.  

The corresponding sides `PQ` and `PR` of the similar triangles `PQR` and `PRS` have lengths 3 and 5.  

It follows that the ratio of the perimeter of `PQR` to that of `PRS` is 3 : 5.  

The perimeter of the triangle `PQR` is `PQ + QR + RP = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`. Let the perimeter of `PRS` be `p`. Then 12 : `p` = 3 : 5. Hence  

`12/p = 3/5`.  

Hence  

`p = 5/3 × 12 = 60/3 = 20`.  

The perimeter of `PQRS` is `PQ + QR + RS + SP`. This is equal to `((PQ + QR + RP)− RP) + ((RS + SP + RP) − RP)`. Thus the perimeter equals the sum of the perimeters of `PQR` and `PRS` less twice the length of `RP`. We deduce that the perimeter of `PQRS` is `12 + 20 − 2 × 5 = 32 − 10 = 22`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Two brothers and three sisters form a single line for a photograph. The two boys refuse to stand next to each other.  

How many different line-ups are possible?

* [ ] 24
* [ ] 36
* [ ] 60
* [x] 72
* [ ] 120

^^^ hint id=5_1 marks=2
There are only 6 ways to arrange the brothers and sisters that keep the brothers apart. Now the challenge is to work out how many ways you can position the brothers and sisters within each arrangement.  

B, S, B, S, S  
B, S, S, B, S  
B, S, S, S, B  
S, B, S, B, S  
S, B, S, S, B  
S, S, B, S, B

We first count the number of ways in which two brothers and three sisters can stand in line without two brothers being next to each other, without regard to which particular brother and which particular sister is in any given position.  

Counting from the left, the first brother can be in the first, second or third position. (He cannot be in fourth position as then the second brother from the left would be next to him in fifth position.)  

If the first brother is in first position, the second brother can be in third, fourth or fifth position. If the first brother is in second position, the second brother can be in fourth or fifth position. If the first brother is in third position, the second brother can only be in fifth position.  

It follows that there are six ways to arrange where the brothers and the sisters are positioned.  

These are listed below using B to represent a brother and S to represent a sister.  

B, S, B, S, S  
B, S, S, B, S  
B, S, S, S, B  
S, B, S, B, S  
S, B, S, S, B  
S, S, B, S, B  

For any two given positions which the two brothers must occupy, they can stand in one of two ways. If the brothers are B1 and B2, these are B1, B2 and B2, B1.  

For any three given positions which the three sisters must occupy, they can stand in one of six ways. If the sisters are S1, S2 and S3, these are S1, S2, S3; S1, S3, S2; S2, S1, S3; S2, S3, S1; S3, S1, S2 and S3, S2, S1.  

Since the 6 choices of which positions the brothers occupy, the 2 choices of how the brothers are put in these positions, and the 6 choices of how the sisters are put in the remaining positions may be made independently, the total number of different line-ups is given by 6 × 2 × 6 = 72.
