# Year 7 Summer Term Synopsis Paper

The purpose of this assignment is for you to review the session materials for one of our previous Year 7 modules, which will help to prepare you for more advanced modules in the Autumn.  

There are 20 questions, some of which you will be able to solve right away and some of which you are likely to find tricky. Questions marked with a skull and crossbones icon are particularly fiendish (but not impossible!).  

At the bottom of these instructions you will find links to PDFs of the session materials for this module. You should take the time to read through these **thoroughly** and you will find that all of the problems are similar to ones in the materials.  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if you’ve given the problem some real thought.  

**Do not rush this assignment!** Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck.  

**You have until the end of August 31st to submit this assignment. Only submit once you have had a proper go at the questions (and have read through the session materials).**  

**After you click Submit, you will not be able to un-submit.** Full written solutions will be displayed and you should scroll down to see the correct answers and read the solutions.

Firstly, we calculate the other two angles in the triangle.  

The angle to the right of the `60°` angle is `360°  −  90°  −  57°  −  162°  = 51°` using angles around a point sum to `360°`.  

The angle below the `60°` angle is `180°  −  51°  −  60°  = 69°` using angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.  

Finally, we calculate `x = 180°  −  90°  −  69°  = 21°` using angles on a straight line sum to `180°`.

Find the value, in degrees, of angle `x` in the diagram below.

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
In the larger of the two triangles in the diagram which contains the angle 𝑥, can you find the other two angles?  
^^^

![](/resources/academy-7sum-week-2/4-sdiagram.png){image align="centre"}  

Firstly, the green angle is `72°` as vertically opposite angles are equal.  

Secondly, the blue angle is `180°  −  125°  = 55°` as co-interior angles sum to `180°`.  
  
Finally, `x = 180°  -  72°  -  55°  = 53°` as angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.

## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
Given that in the diagram on the below the triangle `PQR` is isosceles with `PQ = PR`, find the value, in degrees,  of angle `x`.  

[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]  
  
![](/resources/academy-7sum-week-2/6-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"} 

<input type="number" solution="110"/>

^^^ hint id=3_1_1 marks=1
You should start by calculating the angles in Triangle `TUR`.   
^^^

--- 
Firstly, `∠RTU = 180°  -  ∠STR = 180°  -  120°  = 60°` since `S`, `T` and `U` lie on a straight line, `∠STU = 180°`.  
  
Secondly, `∠TUR = 180°  -  ∠TUQ = 180°  -  95°  = 85°` since `Q`, `U` and `R` lie on a straight line, `∠QUR = 180°`.  
 
Thirdly, `∠TRU = 180°  - ∠RTU  -  ∠TUR = 180°  -  60°  -  85°  = 35°` since the sum of angles in Triangle `TUR` is `180°`.  
  
Fourthly, `∠PQR = ∠PRQ = 35°` since Triangle `PQR` is isosceles and `PQ=PR`.  
  
Finally, `x°  = 180°  -  ∠PQR  -  ∠PRQ = 180°  -  35°  -  35°  = 110°`.

## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
With your tutor you will have discussed that the value of `x` in the diagram below is `180°  -  93° = 87°`, as there is a co-interior pair of angles which must sum to `180°`.  
  
![](/resources/academy-4-week-10/3-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"}  

Is `ABC` a straight line? Choose from the options given below.  

* [ ] Yes, as `∠ABE + ∠BEA + ∠EAB = 180°`
* [ ] Yes, as `∠DAC + ∠ACD + ∠CDA = 180°`
* [ ] Yes, as `∠ABE + ∠EBC = 180°`
* [ ] No, as `∠ABE + ∠EBC < 180°`
* [x] No, as `∠ABE` is not equal to `∠ACD`

^^^ hint id=4_1_1 marks=1
Use Triangle `ABE` to calculate `∠ABE`. Next, think carefully about the parallel angle facts that you know.  
^^^

---

We have that `∠ABE = 180°  −  32°  −  49°  = 99°`, and so it is not equal to `∠ACD`.  

This means that these two angles do not form a pair of equal corresponding angles and so `ABC` is not a straight line.  

(Alternatively, we can see that `∠ABE = 99°` also implies that `∠ABE + ∠EBC > 180°` and so `ABC` is not a straight line.)

## 5.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
In the diagram below, Triangle `QRS` is an isosceles right-angled triangle with `QR = SR` and `∠QRS = 90°`.    

Line segment `PT` intersects `SQ` at `U` and `SR` at `V`.  
  
![](/resources/academy-4-week-10/4-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"} 

If `∠PUQ = ∠RVT = y°`, find the value of `2y`.  
  
[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]

<input type="number" solution="135"/>

^^^ hint id=5_1_1 marks=1
Start by finding the values of `∠RQS` and `∠RSQ`. Next, try to find values or expressions for the remaining angles in Triangle `SVU`.  
^^^

---
`∠RQS = ∠RSQ = 45°`  (Triangle `QRS` is an isosceles right-angled triangle with `QR = SR`)  

`∠SUV = ∠PUQ = y°` and `∠SVU = ∠RVT = y°` (vertically opposite angles are equal)  

`∠VSU + ∠SUV + ∠SVU = 45°  + y°  + y°  = 180°` (interior angles of Triangle `SVU` sum to `180°`)  

Simplifying (and ignoring units) gives `2y = 135`.

## 6.	
::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
There are eight sprinters in the Olympic 100-meter sprint final.  

After the race, the gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.  

In how many different ways can the medals be awarded?  
 
<input type="number" solution="336"/>

---

There are eight choices for who wins the gold medal, then seven choices of who wins the silver and finally six choices for who wins bronze.  

In total, that is `8 × 7 × 6 = 336` ways of awading the medals.

## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=2
For an upcoming Davis Cup tennis match, Team GB need to select one pair of tennis players to compete in an international doubles match.  

If there are 8 players to chose from, how many different pairs could be selected?  
  
<input type="number" solution="28"/> 

^^^ hint id=7_1_1 marks=1
The order in which a pair is chosen is not important, and so AB and BA should be considered the same.  
^^^

---
There are 8 choices for the first player and 7 choices for the second player and so we may think that there are `8 × 7 = 56` different pairs.  

In fact, there are there `(8 × 7)/2 = 28` different pairs because the previous calculation would count each pair twice.  
::: 


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=2
A bag contains 3 white balls, 5 red balls and 7 green balls.  
 
A selection of balls is made.  
 
Of all the selections of balls that could be made, how many contain an odd number of red balls?  

<input type="number" solution="96"/> 

^^^ hint id=8_1_1 marks=1
Focus on how many of each colour could be chosen.  
 
For example, for white we could choose 0, 1, 2, or 3 balls giving four choices.  

How many choices are there for the other colours?  
 
What is the relevant product?  
^^^

---

There are three choices for the number of reds that could be selected (1, 3 or 5), four choices for the number of whites (0 to 3) and eight choices for the number of greens (0 to 7).  

This means there are `3 xx 4 xx 8 = 96` different selections.  

(There is no need to subtract one because we always have at least one red ball.)

## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=2
A maths club wants to choose three of its students to participate in a mathematical team competition.  
 
At this club, `5` students are female and `3` are male.  

If there are no restrictions on who can be part of the team, how many different triples of students can be chosen to compete in the mathematical relay?  

<input type="number" solution="56"/> 

^^^ hint id=8_2_1 marks=1
Call the three chosen students A, B and C.  

They could be selected as ABC or CBA or in a few other orders.  

How many different orders are possible?  

How could you use the answer to the previous problem here?  
^^^

---

There are `8` choices for the first student, `7` choices for the second student and `6` choices for the final student.  

We may think that there are `8 xx 7 xx 6 = 336` different triples of students.  

In fact, there are `(8 xx 7 xx 6)/6 = 56` different triples because the previous calculation would count each triple six times.  

This is because if we label the chosen students A, B and C, we could have chosen them in several different orders.  
 
There are six possible orders: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA (there are `3 xx 2 xx 1 = 6` different orders).
