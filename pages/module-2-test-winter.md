<input type="number" solution="65"/>  

---

The three angles sum to 180° and the other two angles are 25° and 90° so:  

C = 180 – (90 + 25) = 65°

Which of these is largest?

* [x] `3^4`
* [ ] `2^5`
* [ ] `5^2`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `6^2`
{.col-5}

## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What is the mean of the numbers 3, 4, 5, 8, 10?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

There are five numbers in the list so the mean is given by:  

`(3 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10)/5 = 6`
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability that you get three heads?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [x] `1/8`
* [ ] `1/10`
{.col-5}

---

The probability is given by   

`1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
Which of the following numbers is divisible by 4?

* [ ] 1234
* [ ] 2314
* [x] 4312
* [ ] 3142
* [ ] None of these
{.col-5}

---

The divisibility check for 4 requires that we only consider the two-digit number formed by the final two digits.  

Since 12 is divisible by 4 then, using that check, we deduce that 4312 is also divisible by 4.  

We can dismiss the other cases as 34, 14 and 42 are not divisible by 4.
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
In the six-digit number `n5n2n3` the first, third and fifth digits are the same. For which value of n is this number divisible by 3?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [x] There is no such value of n 
{.col-5}

---

By the divisibility check for 3, the number is divisible by 3 precisely when the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  

The sum of the digits is `n + 5 + n + 2 + n + 3 = 3n + 10`.  

This is never divisible by 3 because `(3n + 10)/3 = n + 10/3` (so there is always a remainder of 1).  

So no value of `n` will work (this method is quicker than checking all the options in turn!)  
:::


## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
What is the sum of all the positive integers between 1 and 200 inclusive (ie 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 198 + 199 + 200)?

* [ ] 5,050
* [ ] 10,100
* [ ] 200,000
* [x] 20,100
* [ ] 8,080
{.col-5}

---

Using Gauss’s short cut, we can rewrite the sum as 100 pairs of 201:  

* 1 + 200 = 201
* 2 + 199 = 201
* 3 + 198 = 201

and so on.  

Therefore the total sum is 201 x 100 = 20,100.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-2-test-winter/12-triangle.png){image align="right"}
In the diagram, AB = AC and BD = BC.  

Angle BAC is 40°. What is angle BDC?  

* [ ] 40°
* [ ] 80°
* [ ] 110°
* [ ] 140°
* [x] 70°

---

Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles and angle ACB = angle CBA.  

Since these two angles combine with the 40° to make 180° (angles in a triangle), they are each 70°.  

Since BD = BC, triangle BDC is isosceles and angle BDC = angle DCB.  

But angle DCB is angle ACB, which we have shown is 70°.  

Therefore angle BDC is also 70°.

## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
If `2(x + 4) – 4 = 3x – 9`, what is `x`? 

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 9
* [x] 13
* [ ] -5
* [ ] -7
{.col-5}

---

* Expand the brackets:  `2x + 8 – 4 = 3x – 9`  
* Subtract `2x` from both sides:  `8 – 4 = x – 9`  
* Add 9 to both sides:  `8 – 4 + 9 = x`  
* Simplify the left-hand side:  `13 = x`  
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
I think of a number, double it, subtract 15, add my original number and end up with half the original number. What number did I think of?

* [ ] -2
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 4
* [x] 6
* [ ] 10
{.col-5}

---

Model the problem as an equation. The unknown, `x`, is the original number. Follow the steps:  

* Double:  `2x`  
* Subtract 15:  `2x - 15`  
* Add the original number:  `2x - 15 + x`  
* End up with half the original number:  `2x - 15 + x = 1/2 x`  

Now solve this equation:  

* Collect like terms:  `3x - 15 = 1/2 x`  
* Multiple both sides by 2:  `6x - 30 = x`  
* Add 30 to both sides:  `6x = x + 30`  
* Subtract x from both sides:  `5x = 30`  
* Divide both sides by 5:  `x = 6`

## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
The theme music for the famous science fiction film _2001: A Space Odyssey_ is taken from _Also Sprach Zarathustra_, which was written by Richard Strauss in 1896.  

How many years was that before the film itself was produced in 1968?  

* [x] 72
* [ ] 33
* [ ] 28
* [ ] 105
* [ ] 82
{.col-5}

---

1968 – 1896 = 72.

## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
In the diagram, five rectangles of the same size are shown with each side labelled with a number.  

![](/resources/module-1b-test-winter/16-squares-choices.jpg){image align="center"}
These rectangles are placed in the positions I to V as shown, so the numbers on the sides that touch each other are equal.  

![](/resources/module-1b-test-winter/16-squares-map.jpg){image align="center"}

Which of the rectangles should be placed in position I?   

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [x] C
* [ ] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

Look first at the numbers labelling the left- and right-hand sides of the rectangles.  

It can be seen that only rectangles _A_, _C_ and _E_ can be arranged in a row of three with their touching sides equal and so they must form the top row of the diagram.  

The only common value on the right- and left-hand sides of rectangles _B_ and _D_ is 3 and so rectangle _D_ will be placed in position IV.  

Therefore, the rectangle to be placed in position I needs to have 2 on its lower edge.  

Hence rectangle _C_ should be placed on position I (with _A_ in position II, _E_ in position III and _B_ in position V).

## 17.
::: problem id=17_1 marks=1
The Bean family are very particular about beans. At every meal all Beans eat some beans.  

Pa Bean always eats more beans than Ma Bean but never eats more than half the beans.  

Ma Bean always eats the same number of beans as both children together and the two children always eat the same number of beans as each other.  

At their last meal they ate 23 beans altogether.  

How many beans did Pa Bean eat?

* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9
* [x] 11
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 15
{.col-5}

---

Pa Bean does not eat more than half the beans, so he eats at most 11 beans.  

Ma Bean eats the same number of beans as both children together, so she eats an even number of beans which is at least one quarter of the total number of beans eaten. Therefore she eats at least 6 beans.  

If she does eat 6 beans, then Pa Bean eats 11 beans, which is consistent with the information given.  

However, if Ma Bean eats 8 or more beans, then Pa Bean eats at most 7 beans, and this is impossible as we are told that Pa Bean eats more beans than Ma Bean.  

So Pa Bean eats 11 beans.

## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
Jamal writes down a sequence of six integers. The rule he uses is "after the first three terms, each term is the sum of the three previous terms".

His sequence is __, __, __, 8, 13, 25.  

What is his first term?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

---

Working backwards, the 25 must be the sum of 13, 8 and the third term. So the third term is 4.  

Next, the 13 must be the sum of 8, 4 and the second term, so the second term is 1.  

Finally, 8 must be the sum of 4, 1 and the first term.  

So the first term is 3.

The White Rabbit has an appointment to see the Red Queen at 4pm every day apart from the weekends.  

On Monday, he arrives 16 minutes late.  Each day after that, he hurries more and more, and so manages to halve the amount of time that he arrives late each day.   

On what day of the week does he arrive just 15 seconds late?  

* [ ] Monday
* [x] Tuesday
* [ ] Wednesday
* [ ] Thursday
* [ ] Friday
{.col-5}

---

On Tuesday the White Rabbit will be 8 minutes late, on Wednesday 4 minutes late, on Thursday 2 minutes late, and on Friday 1 minute late.  

So on the following Monday the White Rabbit will be 30 seconds late and on the day after that he will be 15 seconds late.

All four L-shapes shown in the diagram are to be placed in the 4 by 4 grid so that all sixteen cells are covered and there is no overlap.  

Each piece can be rotated or reflected before being placed and the black dot is visible from both sides.  

How many of the 16 cells of the grid could contain the black dot?  

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 12

The first figure shows a possible configuration of the four L shapes fitting into the square and illustrates four cells which could contain the black dot.  

When this figure is roated in one direction through 90, 180 and 270, it is clear that all twelve cells on the outside of the square could contain the black dot.   

Finally, the second figure shows that each of the four cells in the cenre of the square could also contain the black dot.  

So each of the 16 cells in the diagram could contain the black dot.
