::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ In this next puzzle, you must use all of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 so that the row and column have the same total.  

There are three different ways to solve this puzzle, all of which give the same total.  

What is the magic total for the lines?

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
