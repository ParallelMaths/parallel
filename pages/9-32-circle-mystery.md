__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2014 (1) --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What is 25% of `3/4`?

* [x] `3/16`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [ ] `1`
* [ ] `3`
{.col-5}

---

As 25% of a number is one quarter of it, 25% of `3/4` is `1/4 × 3/4 = 3/16`.

## 2. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2014 (1) Extension --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ To the nearest whole number, what percentage of `3/4` is `2/3`?

<input type="number" solution="89"/> %

---

We can re-write the question as:  

`2/3 = x/100 × 3/4`  

Therefore,  

`x = (4 × 100 × 2)/(3 × 3) = 88.9%`

## 3. Circle mystery

This is a video from the terrific Numberphile channel on YouTube. It features one of the world’s greatest mathematicians, Neil Sloane. As well making breakthroughs in mathematics, he has written two books on rock-climbing. Watch this video, which looks at an apparently simple question about circles … then answer the questions after.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ According to the rules in the video, which of these arrangements of two circles is not allowed?

::: problem id=3_2 marks=2
__3.2__ According the rules, how many ways can you arrange two circles?

<input type="number" solution="3"/>
:::

::: problem id=3_3 marks=2
__3.3__ Here are some arrangements for three circles. According the rules, which two arrangements are the same? Add up the two numbers of the duplicate arrangements and enter it in the box.

<input type="number" solution="16"/>

Arrangements 7 and 9 are the same, so the total is 16.

::: problem id=3_4 marks=3
__3.4__ According the rules, how many ways can you arrange four circles?

<input type="number" solution="173"/>

::: problem id=3_5 marks=3
__3.5__ According the rules, how many ways can you arrange five circles?

<input type="number" solution="16951"/>

## 4. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2014 (15) --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1.__ Zac halves a certain number and then adds 8 to the result. He finds that he obtains the same answer if he doubles his original number and then subtracts 8 from the result.  

What is Zac’s original number?

* [ ] `8 2/3`
* [ ] `9 1/3`
* [ ] `9 2/3`
* [ ] `10 1/3`
* [x] `10 2/3`
{.col-5}

---

Let Zac’s original number be `x`. When Zac halves this and adds 8 he obtains `1/2 x + 8`. When he doubles his original number and subtracts 8, the result is `2x − 8`.  

As these answers are the same, `1/2 x + 8 = 2x - 8`. Therefore `3/2 x = 16`. Hence `x = 2/3 × 16 = 32/3 = 10 2/3`.

## 5. Parallel emails

If you use Parallel on an email address from your school, some school IT systems prevent you from receiving the emails we send out to remind you when a new Parallelogram is released, or when we have another exciting and nerdy maths thing to tell you about. To avoid this, you could give us a different email address we can contact you on - either a personal email address, or one for you parents or guardian. If you'd like to do that, [you can put it in this form](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/k6y9h6){target="_blank"}, but please ask a parent first if you are not yet 13 years old.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
__5.1__ If you do want to give us an alternate email address, be sure to click the link above (if you haven’t already). Either way, here's a free mark, just for being a fan of Parallel.

* [x] Thank you!

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
