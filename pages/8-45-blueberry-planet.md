*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

__1.1__ Which of these diagrams could be drawn without taking the pen off the page and without drawing along a line already drawn?

For it to be possible to draw a figure without taking the pen off the paper and without drawing along an existing line, there must be at most two points in the figure at which an odd number of lines meet.

Only E satisfies this condition.

__2.1.__ The diagram shows a single floor tile in which the outer square has side 8cm and the inner square has side 6cm.

If Adam Ant walks once around the perimeter of the inner square and Annabel Ant walks once around the perimeter of the outer square, how much further does Annabel walk than Adam?

* [ ] 2 cm
* [ ] 4 cm
* [ ] 6 cm
* [x] 8 cm
* [ ] 16 cm
{.col-5}

---

Adam Ant walks 24 cm, while Annabel Ant walks 32 cm, so Annabel walks 8 cm further.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1.__ Sir Lance has a lot of tables and chairs in his house. Each rectangular table seats eight people and each round table seats five people.

What is the smallest number of tables he will need to use to seat 35 guests and himself, without any of the seating around these tables remaining unoccupied?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

There are 36 people to be seated so at least five tables will be required. The number of circular tables must be even.

However, five rectangular tables will seat 40 people and three rectangular and two circular will seat 34. So at least six tables are needed.

Two rectangular and four circular tables do seat 36 people: so six is the minimum number of tables.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Nicky has to choose 7 different positive whole numbers whose mean is 7.

What is the largest possible such number she could choose?

* [ ] 7
* [x] 28
* [ ] 34
* [ ] 43
* [ ] 49
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5_1
Since the mean is 7, the total must be `7 × 7 = 49`. She can have one large number, if she makes the others as small as possible.
^^^

---

The seven numbers must total 49 if their mean is to be 7. The largest possible number will occur when the other six numbers are as small as possible, that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So the required number is 49 - 21 = 28.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
