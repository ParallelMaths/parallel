::: problem id=1_1 marks=6
__1.1__ Box `P` has `p` chocolates and box `Q` has `q` chocolates, where `p` and `q` are both odd and `p > q`.  

What is the smallest number of chocolates which would have to be moved from box `P` to box `Q` so that box `Q` has more chocolates than box `P`?

* [ ] `(q - p + 2)/2`
* [x] `(p - q + 2)/2`
* [ ] `(q + p - 2)/2`
* [ ] `(p - q - 2)/2`
* [ ] `(q + p + 2)/2`

---

Because `p` and `q` are both odd, `p + q` is even. If the chocolates were shared equally between the boxes there would be `1/2 (p + q)` chocolates in each box.  

So the least number of chocolates there must be in box `Q` if it is to have more chocolates than box `P` is `1/2 (p + q) + 1`.  

Because box `Q` starts with `q` chocolates in it, to end up with `1/2 (p + q) + 1` in box `Q` the number of chocolates we need to transfer from box `P` to box `Q` is  

`((p + q)/2 + 1) - q = (p - q)/2 + 1 = (p - q + 2)/2`

__2.1__ The diagram shows two arrows drawn on separate 4 cm × 4 cm grids.
One arrow points North and the other points West.

When the two arrows are drawn on the same 4 cm × 4 cm grid (still
pointing North and West) they overlap. What is the area of overlap?

* [ ] 4 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 4 `1/2` cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 5 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 5 `1/2` cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 6 cm<sup>2</sup>

By drawing one arrow on top of the other, as shown, we see that the region
of overlap covers the whole of 4 of the 1 cm × 1 cm squares into which the
grid is divided, and 4 halves of these squares. So the area of the overlapping
region is 4 + 4 (`1/2`) = 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=5
__3.1__ Which of the following numbers is divisible by 7?

* [ ] 111
* [ ] 1111
* [ ] 11111
* [x] 111111
* [ ] 1111111

---

The problem may be solved by dividing each of the alternatives in turn by 7,
but the prime factorisation of 1001, i.e. `1001 = 7 × 11 × 13`, leads to the
conclusion that 111 111, which is `111 × 1001`, is a multiple of 7.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
__4.1__ What is the remainder when the square of 49 is divided by the square root of 49?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 7
{.col-5}

---

Because `49 = 7 × 7`, it follows both that `sqrt(49) = 7` and that 7 is a factor of 49.  

Therefore 7 is also a factor of `49^2`.  

Hence the remainder when the square of 49 is divided by the square root of 49 is 0.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=6
__5.1__ After playing 500 games, my success rate at Spider Solitaire is 49%. Assuming that I win every game from now on, how many extra games do I need to play in order that my success rate increases to 50%?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 5
* [x] 10
* [ ] 50
{.col-5}

---

Since I have won 49% of my first 500 games, so far I have won `49/100 × 500 = 49 × 5 = 245` games. So I have lost `500 - 245 = 255` games. I need now to win enough games so that I have won as many as I have lost.

So, assuming I win every game from now on, I need to win `255 - 245 = 10` more games.

Another approach is to say that I am going play and win `W` more games. At that point, the number of games that I win will be:  

`(49/100 × 500 + W)/(500 + W) = 50% or 0.5`  

Therefore `(245 + W)/(500 + W) = 0.5`  

`245 + W = 250 + 0.5W`  
`0.5W = 5`  
`W = 10 `

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
