*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Line multiplication

There are loads of tricks we can keep up our sleeve to make calculation easier.  

It all comes down to selecting the right tool for the right calculation.  

Check out this quick and easy method for multiplying numbers using only lines!

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Which calculation would this method be most appropriate for?

* [ ] 9,999 × 8,989
* [x] 24 × 13
* [ ] 365 + 675
* [ ] 16 × 19 × 24 × 65

__1.2__ Have a go at using this method to calculate 23 × 32

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1
23 × 32 can be visualised as follows:

__1.3__ The method above relies on being able to quickly count up the dots at the intersection.  

Let’s see how quick you are at counting - count these oranges as fast as you can!

You can make life easier for yourself by moving the rightmost orange from the row of 5, into the row that only containts 3 oranges.  

This makes for 4 rows of 4 oranges, giving 16 oranges.  

Maybe you had another interesting way of counting them.

__1.4__ The video explains how the line multiplication method extends to three-digit numbers.  

Which calculation is shown in this image?  

* [ ] 123 × 124  
* [ ] 124 × 321  
* [x] 124 × 312  
* [ ] 132 × 431

__2.1__ I was given a 1500-piece jigsaw of Albert Einstein.  

Half the pieces are missing, and half of the rest are damaged.  

How many good pieces are there?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 350
* [x] 375
* [ ] 500
* [ ] 750

__3.1__ Which number is NOT a factor of 101,010?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [x] 11

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
