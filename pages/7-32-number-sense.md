*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Finding something odd

The 1<sup>st</sup> odd number is 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What is the 9<sup>th</sup> odd number?

<input solution="17"/>
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ What is the 99<sup>th</sup> odd number?

<input solution="197"/>

---

1<sup>st</sup> odd number is 1,  
2<sup>nd</sup> odd number is 3,  
3<sup>rd</sup> odd number is 5,  
...so the rule is “double the position of the number and subtract 1 to find the appropriate odd number.”

Therefore the 99<sup>th</sup> odd number is (2 × 99) – 1 = 197.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2018 (4) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ The perimeter of the regular decagon `P` is 8 times the perimeter of the regular octagon `Q`.  

Each edge of the regular octagon `Q` is 10 cm long.  

How long is each edge of the regular decagon `P`?

* [ ] 8 cm
* [ ] 10 cm
* [ ] 40 cm
* [ ] 60 cm
* [x] 64 cm
{.col-5}

---

An octagon has eight edges. Therefore the perimeter of the regular octagon `Q` is `8 × 10 cm = 80` cm.  

The perimeter of the regular decagon `P` is eight times that of the regular octagon `Q` and is therefore `8 × 80` cm, that is, `640` cm.  

A decagon has 10 edges. Therefore the length of each edge of `Q` is given by  

`(640 ÷ 10) cm = 64` cm.

## 3. Number Sense

This is another interesting video by Jo Boaler. Like last week’s video from Jo, I think it illustrates how we might all see a problem differently and how there are many ways to solve a problem, but they all lead to the same answer.

## 4. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2018 (11) --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1__ How many digits are there in the correct answer to the calculation 123,123,123,123 ÷ 123?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [x] 10
* [ ] 12
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1
The answer isn't 4!
^^^

---

From the long division sum shown below, we see that  

123 123 123 123 ÷ 123 = 1 001 001 001.  

We see that there are 10 digits in this answer.

## 5. Simple Code

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ There is a rule that transforms 4-digit numbers into a new number. Try to work out  the rule and find out what the number 1,000 would be transformed into

* 8809 = 6
* 7111 = 0
* 2172 = 0
* 6666 = 4
* 1111 = 0
* 3213 = 0
* 1000 = ?

<input solution="3"/>

^^^ hint id=5_1
Look at the number of circles or loops in each digit.
^^^

---

The rule involves counting the number of circles or loops in each digit (e.g., 1, 2 & 3 have no loops, but 6, 9 & 0 have one loop each, and 8 has two loops). This means 1,000 has 3 loops and the answer is, therefore, 3.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
