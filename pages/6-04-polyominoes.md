*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Polyominoes

Yes, Polyominoes are just like Dominoes, but better!  

Watch this Numberphile video about Pentominoes and answer a few questions.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What type of Polyominoes are used in the retro game Tetris?

* [ ] Pentominoes
* [ ] Triominoes
* [x] Tetrominoes
* [ ] Flamingoes
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ How many different Pentominoes are there?  

<input type="number" solution="12"/>
:::

Investigate the perimeter of the Pentominoes.

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ How many Pentominoes have a perimeter of 10?

<input type="number" solution="1"/>
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=1
__1.4__ How many Pentominoes have a perimeter of 11?

<input type="number" solution="0"/>
:::

::: problem id=1_5 marks=1
__1.5__ How many Pentominoes have a perimeter of 12?

<input type="number" solution="11"/>
:::

::: problem id=1_6 marks=1
__1.6__ What is the total perimeter of all the Pentominoes?

<input type="number" solution="142"/>

---

All but one of the Pentominoes have a perimeter of 12.  

The odd pentomino out has a perimeter of 10.  

(12 × 11) + (10 × 1) gives us a total combined perimeter of 142.

## 2 Hexominoes and nets of cubes

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ All nets of cubes are hexominoes, but not all hexominoes are nets of cubes.  

Which of the following polyominoes will NOT fold up to make a cube?

![](/resources/6-04-polyominoes/4-nets.png){image align="center"}

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [x] C
* [ ] D
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ Which of the following cubes can NOT be made from the net shown?

* [ ] A
* [x] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
