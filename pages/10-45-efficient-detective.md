__1.1__ 30 ÷ 0.2 equals

* [ ] 1.5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 15
* [x] 150
* [ ] 600
{.col-5}

---

30 ÷ 0.2 = 300 ÷ 2 = 150, or 30 ÷ 0.2 = 30 ÷ 1/5 = 30 × 5 = 150.

This video by Tom Scott is nothing to do with maths, but it is interesting, so it’s worth two minutes of your time.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=5
__3.1__ Inspector Remorse estimates that she can solve the average murder in `x` hours, a bank robbery in half that time, and a car theft in one third of the time she takes to solve a bank robbery. How many hours would she expect to take in solving two murders, six car thefts and four bank robberies?

* [ ] `3x`
* [x] `5x`
* [ ] `6x`
* [ ] `7x`
* [ ] `12x`
{.col-5}

---

Two murders: `2x` hours;  
Six car thefts: `6(x/6)` = `x` hours;  
Four bank robberies: `4(x/2)` = `2x` hours.  

Total = `(2x + x + 2x)` hours = `5x` hours.

__4.1__ Which is the largest of these fractions?

* [ ] `7/15`
* [ ] `3/7`
* [ ] `11/23`
* [ ] `4/9`
* [x] `6/11`
{.col-5}

`6/11` is the only one of these fractions which is greater than `1/2`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ Timmy, Tammy and Tommy all have tummy ache! They all set off separately to visit their doctor, leaving their homes at exactly the same time. Timmy cycles the 8km to the surgery at an average speed of 20 km/h; Tammy walks the 1.2km to the surgery at an average speed of 4 km/h and Tommy drives the 16.5km to the surgery at an average speed of 45 km/h. In what order do they arrive at the surgery?

* [ ] Tommy, Timmy, Tammy
* [ ] Timmy, Tommy, Tammy
* [ ] Tommy, Tammy, Timmy
* [ ] Tammy, Timmy, Tommy
* [x] Tammy, Tommy, Timmy
{.col-3}

---

Timmy takes 24 minutes (8/20 of 1 hour) to reach the surgery; Tammy takes 18 minutes (12/40 of 1 hour) and Tommy takes 22 minutes (33/90 of 1 hour). The order, therefore, is Tammy, Tommy, Timmy.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
