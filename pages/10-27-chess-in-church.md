__1.1__ Which of these statements is not relevant to the picture below?

* [ ] The queen moves in all directions.
* [ ] The bishop only moves diagonally.
* [x] The knight moves in an L-shape.

Chess involves queens, bishops and knights, but this picture only shows a queen and a bishop on the checkerboard floor of a church.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ The coach of the Irish hockey team has a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour. If it travels this speed for two hours, roughly how many kilometres does it travel?

* [ ] 120
* [ ] 160
* [x] 200
* [ ] 240
* [ ] 280
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1 marks=1
This is an unusual question, because it expects you apply some previous knowledge, i.e., how many kilometres equal one mile. Roughly, there are more than 1.5 km per mile, but less than 2 km per mile. The exact value is 1.61 km per mile, or 21/13 km per mile. 21 and 13 are easy to remember because they are in the Fibonacci sequence, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
^^^

One mile is approximately equal to 1.6 kilometres so 120 miles are approximately equal to 200 kilometres.

__3.1__ In the diagram, `∠MON = 130°`.  

The reflection of `OP` in `OM` is `OQ` and the reflection of `OP` in `ON` is `OR`.  

What is the size of the obtuse angle `∠QOR`?

* [x] 100°
* [ ] 120°
* [ ] 140°
* [ ] 150°
* [ ] 160°
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=3_1_1 marks=1
If we say `∠MOP = α`, then `∠PON = 130° – α`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3_1_2 marks=1
Then, `∠QOR = α + α + (130° – α) + (130° – α)`.
^^^

As `OQ` is the reflection of `OP` in `OM`, `∠QOM = ∠POM`; similarly, `∠RON = ∠PON`.  

Hence reflex `∠QOR = 2 × ∠MON = 260°`.  

Therefore `∠QOR = 360° - 260° = 100°`.

Alternatively, if we say `∠MOP = α`, then `∠PON = 130° – α`.  

Then, `∠QOR = α + α + (130° – α) + (130° – α)`.  

But, if the reflex angle is `260°`, the obtuse angle must be `100°`.

__5.1__ The diagram shows a 1 × `x` rectangular plank which fits neatly inside a 10 × 10 square frame. What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] `10 + 2 sqrt(2)`
* [x] `10 sqrt(2) - 1`
* [ ] `10 sqrt(2) - 2`
* [ ] `10 + sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `12`

The trick with this question is to measure the red line, part of the diagonal of the square, which is the same length as the side of the rectangle.

The figure shows the top left-hand corner of the complete diagram and we see by symmetry that the perpendicular from the corner to the short side of the rectangle has length `1/2`.  

Thus the diagonal of the square may be divided into three sections of length `1/2`, `x` and `1/2` respectively.

Thus the length of this diagonal `= sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10 sqrt(2)`, so `x = 10 sqrt(2) - 1`.
