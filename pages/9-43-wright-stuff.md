## 1. Inspirational teachers

Arthur Cayley is one of the great British mathematicians of the Victorian era.  

His father wanted him to become a merchant join the family business, but Cayley’s teacher at King’s College School persuaded the father that the boy had a tremendous mathematical talent which should be encouraged, not wasted.  

As a result, the young Cayley went to Cambridge University and flourished.  

I am mentioning this, because teachers can have a tremendous influence on our lives.  

Here is a video about England Arsenal footballer Ian Wright meeting the teacher who inspired him and who changed his life.  

It’s a really emotional clip. I have watched it several times, and it still moves me.

This question is not that hard to solve algebraically or by drawing some lines and seeing some symmetries. However, I decided to take an extreme version of squeezing one of the triangles and expanding the other, so that we have the following, which has an area which is easy to calculate. This means that the answer is either the shaded area or “more information needed”.

We divide the rectangle into four smaller rectangles by the vertical dashed lines as shown in the figure. It is then evident that the shaded area is the sum of exactly half the area of each of the smaller rectangles.  

Therefore the total shaded area is half the total area of the original rectangle. So the shaded area is `1/2 (3 × 14)` cm<sup>2</sup> = 21 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

We could also solve this question algebraically. We let the top edges of the two shaded triangles have lengths `a` cm and `b` cm, respectively, so that `a + b = 14`. The two shaded triangles have areas `1/2 (a × 3)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 a` cm<sup>2</sup> and `1/2 (b × 3)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 b` cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Hence their total area is

`(3/2 a + 3/2 b)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 (a + b)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 × 14` cm<sup>2</sup> = 21 cm<sup>2</sup>.

__3.1__ In a sequence, each term after the first two terms is the mean of all the terms which come before that term. The first term is 8 and the tenth term is 26.

What is the second term?

Here it is actually a little easier to see what is going on if we think about the general case of a sequence in which every term after the second is the mean of all the terms that come before it.  

Consider a sequence generated by this rule whose first two terms are `a` and `b`. The mean of these terms is `(a + b)/2`, and so the first three terms are  

`a, b, (a + b)/2`.  

The sum of these three terms is the same as the sum of the three terms  

`(a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`  

and it follows that the mean of the first three terms is also (a + b)/2. So the first four terms of the sequence are  

`a, b, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`.  

These have the same sum as the four terms  

`(a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`.

It follows that the mean of the first four terms is also `(a + b)/2` and that therefore this is the fifth term of the sequence, and so on. We thus see that each term of the sequence after the first two is equal to the mean of the first two terms.  

In the sequence we are given in the question the first term is 8 and the tenth term is 26. It follows that 26 is the mean of the first two terms. Hence their sum is 2 × 26 = 52. Since the first term is 8, we deduce that the second term is 52 − 8 = 44.

We work out the area that is not shaded and subtract this area from that of the large square.  

The area that is not shaded is made up of the four corner squares and four trapeziums.  

The total area of the squares is, in cm<sup>2</sup>,  

`1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30`.  

We now use the fact that the area of a trapezium is given by the formula  

`1/2 (a + b)h`,

where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides, and `h` is their distance apart.  

The values of `a`, `b` and `h` for the trapeziums `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S`, as labelled in the diagram, can be calculated from the side lengths of the squares, and are shown in the diagram. We therefore have that  

area of `P = 1/2 (1 + 2) × 8 = 12`,  
area of `Q = 1/2 (2 + 3) × 6 = 15`,  
area of `R = 1/2 (3 + 4) × 4 = 14`, and  
area of `S = 1/2 (4 + 1) × 6 = 15`.  

It follows that the total area of the trapeziums is  

`12 + 15 + 14 + 15 = 56`.  

The large square has area `11^2` cm<sup>2</sup> = 121 cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the area of the shaded quadrilateral is, in cm<sup>2</sup>, `121 − 30 − 56 = 35`.

__5.1__ In square `RSTU` a quarter-circle arc with centre `S` is drawn from `T` to `R`.  

A point `P` on this arc is 1 unit from `TU` and 8 units from `RU`.  

What is the length of the side of square `RSTU`?

Suppose that `x` is the length of the sides of the square `RSTU`. We need to find the value of `x`.  

We let `K` be the point where the perpendicular from `P` to `RS` meets `RS`, and `L` be the point where the perpendicular from `P` to `ST` meets `ST`, as shown in the figure. Then `PK` has length `x − 1`, and so also does `LS`. Also, `PL` has length `x − 8`.  

Because `PS` is a radius of the quarter circle, its length is the same as that of the sides of the square, namely, `x`.

Therefore `SLP` is a right-angled triangle in which the hypotenuse has length `x`, and the other two sides have lengths `x − 1` and `x − 8`. Hence, by Pythagoras’ Theorem,  

`(x − 1)^2 + (x − 8)^2 = x^2`.  

Multiplying out the squares, we get  

`(x^2 − 2x + 1) + (x^2 − 16x + 64) = x^2`,  

which we can rearrange as  

`x^2 − 18x + 65 = 0`.  

We can factorize the quadratic on the left-hand side of this equation to give the equivalent equation  

`(x − 5)(x − 13) = 0`,  

which has the solutions `x = 5` and `x = 13`. Since `x − 8` is the length of PL and therefore cannot be negative, `x ≠ 5`. Therefore `x = 13`.

We use the notation `△XYZ` for the area of a triangle `XYZ`.  

We let `P`, `Q` and `R` be the vertices of the triangle, and let `S`, `T` and `U` be the points one quarter of the way along each side, as shown in the figure.  

We let `K` and `L` be the points where the perpendiculars from `P` and `T`, respectively, meet `QR`.  

The area of a triangle is half the base multiplied by the height of the triangle. Therefore  

`△PQR = 1/2 (QR × PK)`.

We now obtain an expression for `△TSR`.  

Because S is one quarter of the way along `QR`, `SR = 3/4 QR`.  

In the triangles `PKR` and `TLR`, the angles at `K` and `L` are both right angles, and the angle at `R` is common to both triangles. It follows that these triangles are similar. Therefore  

`TL/PK = TR/PR = 1/4`,  

and hence  

`TL = 1/4PK`.  

It follows that  

`△STR = 1/2 (SR × T L) = 1/2 (3/4 QR × 1/4 PK) = 3/16 (1/2 (QR × PK)) = 3/16 △PQR`.  

Similarly,  

`△TPU = 3/16 △PQR`.  

It follows that the fraction of the area of triangle `PQR` that is shaded is  

`1 − 3/16 − 3/16 = 5/8`.
