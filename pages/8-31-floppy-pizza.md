## 1. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2018 (10) --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ Adding four of the five fractions `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/6`, `1/9`, and `1/18` gives a total of 1.  

Which of the fractions is not used?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/9`
* [ ] `1/18`
{.col-5}

---

There are five different ways of selecting four of the five fractions given in the question. One method would be to try these different combinations in turn to find the four fractions that add up to 1.  

However, it is much quicker to begin by adding all five of the fractions. This will give an answer greater than 1. We will then be able to see which fraction we need to remove to reduce the sum to 1.  

By putting all of the fractions over the common denominator 18, we see that

`1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/9 + 1/18 = (9 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/18 = 21/18 = 7/6 = 1 + 1/6`.  

We see from this calculation that to obtain a total of 1 it is the fraction `1/6` that is not used.

## 2. Don Bradman’s duck

Don Bradman had several pets, but his favourite pet was a duck called Duckminster Fuller...

Actually, that’s not true. Bradman was a heroic cricketer, and this video is all about his sad farewell to the game he loved. Even if you don’t like cricket, I challenge you not be moved by this tale of sporting genius and averages. By the way, a duck is the name given to the score when a batsman scores no runs.

::: problem id=2 marks=3
__2.1__ Prior to the last match, Bradman had scored 6,996 runs from 69 innings, and needed 4 more runs to have a career average of 100 from 70 innings.  

How many runs would have given Bradman a career average of 99.99 (rounded to 4 significant figures)?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-3}

`(6,996 + 3)/70 = 99.9857`, which is 99.99 to 4 s.f.

<!--- 2017 (15) --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ What is the remainder when the square of 49 is divided by the square root of 49?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 7
{.col-5}

---

Because `49 = 7 × 7`, it follows both that `√49 = 7` and that 7 is a factor of 49.

Therefore 7 is also a factor of `49^2`.  

Hence the remainder when the square of 49 is divided by the square root of 49 is 0.
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ Find, without using a calculator, the value of `49^2 ÷ √49`.

<input solution="343"/>

---

`49^2 ÷ √49 = (7^2)^2 ÷ 7 = 7^4 ÷ 7 = 7^3 = 343`

## 4. Floppy pizza

When you are a mathematician, then the world becomes amazing. Even eating pizza becomes amazing, as revealed in this video by Cliff Stoll. You might find some bits of the video confusing, but stick with it and see if you can understand why we eat pizza slices in a particular way.

__4.1__ For shape A, what is the Gaussian curvature at the black dot?

* [x] Negative
* [ ] Zero
* [ ] Positive
{.col-3}

---

The horizontal line has (+) curvature and the vertical line has (-) curvature, so the Gaussian curvature is negative.

__4.2__ For shape B, what is the Gaussian curvature at the black dot?

* [ ] Negative
* [x] Zero
* [ ] Positive
{.col-3}

---

The horizontal line has (+) curvature and the vertical line has zero curvature, so the Gaussian curvature is zero.

* [ ] Negative
* [ ] Zero
* [x] Positive

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ A large solid cube is cut into two pieces by a single plane cut.   

How many of the following four shapes could be the shape of the cross-section formed by the cut?

^^^ hint id=5_1
The third cross-section (with 4 sides) is definitely possible.

^^^ hint id=5_2
The fourth cross-section (with 6 sides) is definitely possible.

We see from the figures below that all four shapes are possible.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
