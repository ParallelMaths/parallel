*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s summer and the school year is over (or maybe it’s nearly over), but that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of mathematics. If you are taking mathematics seriously and if you are having fun with it (being serious and having fun can go together), then it is important that you keep the numbers and geometry parts of your brain at least a little bit busy over the summer. I am hoping that your teacher will have set you some holiday work, but on top of that here is a longer than usual Parallelogram.  

Most of the questions are from past Intermediate Maths Challenge papers, but I have also added a sprinkling of other things to make the Parallelogram (even) more interesting.   

It will take you an hour or two to complete this Parallelogram, so maybe tackle it across three or four sessions … but don’t forget to complete it before the new term starts.  

And... if you have missed any earlier Parallelograms then the summer is a great time to do some catching up.

__1.1__ What is the value of 1 − 0.2 + 0.03 − 0.004?

* [ ] 0.834
* [ ] 0.926

We have 1 − 0.2 = 0.8 and so 1 − 0.2 + 0.03 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83, and therefore 1 − 0.2 + 0.03 − 0.004 = 0.83 − 0.004 = 0.826.  

Note that in the context of the IMC where we just need to decide which of the options is correct, it isn’t really necessary to do this exact arithmetic. Looking at the terms making up the sum it is evident that the answer is just greater than 0.8, and the presence of the term −0.004 shows that the digit in the thousandths column is 6. So 0.826 is the correct option.

We see that 11 minutes 53 seconds is just under 12 minutes, and 1576 is just under 1600. So the number of steps per minute is approximately  

`1600/12 = 400/3 ∼ 133`.  

We conclude that, of the given options, 130 is the best approximation.

Let the vertices of the square be labelled `K`, `L`, `M`, `N` and those of the regular pentagon `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, as shown in the diagram.  

We use the fact that the interior angles of a regular pentagon are each 108°. It follows that `∠RST = ∠STP = 108°`. Because it is the angle of a square, `∠SNT = 90°`. By the Exterior Angle Theorem, `∠RST = ∠SNT + ∠NTS`. Therefore, `108° = 90° + ∠NTS`. It follows that `∠NTS = 108° − 90° = 18°`.  

Finally, because the angles at `T` on the line `KN` have sum `180°`,  

`∠NTS + ∠STP + ∠PTK = 180°`,  

that is,  

`18° + 108° + x° = 180°`.  

We conclude that  

`x = 180 − 18 − 108 = 54`.

We have `2^5 = 32` which is not a square.  

In the context of the IMC we can assume that only one option is correct and that it is sufficient just to find it. However, for a complete solution we need to check that none of the other options is a square. Note that we can show this without evaluating any of them, as follows. We have `1^6 = (1^3)^2`, `3^4 = (3^2)^2`, `4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^6 = (2^3)^2`, and so these are all squares, and it is immediate that `5^2` is a square.

We can assume that we have chosen units so that each side of the regular hexagon has length 1. It follows that the length of the perimeter of this hexagon is 6. Therefore the length of the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 6. Hence each of its sides has length 2.  

It follows that we can divide the equilateral triangle into 4 smaller equilateral triangles each with side length 1 as shown. The hexagon may be divided into 6 equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown.  

It follows that the ratio of their areas is 4:6, that is, 2:3.

We can think of a tetrahedron as a pyramid with a triangular base.  

The base has 3 vertices and there is 1 more vertex, called the apex, at the peak of the pyramid. So a tetrahedron has 4 vertices.  

The base has 3 edges, and there are 3 more edges joining the vertices of the base to the apex. Therefore a tetrahedron has 3 + 3 = 6 edges.  

Finally, we observe that 4 × 6 = 24.

![](/resources/9-35-summer-sums/9-shape-answer.jpg){image align="right"}

We use the fact that for every polygon the sum of its exterior angles is 360°.   

The shaded angles in the diagram on the right form one set of external angles. Therefore  

`q + s + u + w + y = 360`.  

The other marked angles form another set of external angles and therefore  

`r + t + v + x + p = 360`.  

[Alternatively, we could argue that the angles marked `q°` and `r°` are vertically opposite and therefore `q = r`, and, similarly, `s = t`, `u = v`, `w = x` and `p = y`, and therefore `r + t + v + x + p = q + s + u + w + y = 360`.]  

It follows that  

`p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z = (q + s + u + w + y) + (r + t + v + x + p)`  
`= 360 + 360`  
`= 720`.

---

First, we note that `3^3 × 5^5 × 7^7` is a positive odd integer greater than 1 and so is equal to `2n + 1`, for some positive integer `n`.  

It follows that  

`2^2 × 3^3 × 5^5 × 7^7 = 4 × (3^3 × 5^5 × 7^7)`  
`= 4(2n + 1)`  
`= 8n + 4.`  

Therefore when `2^2 × 3^3 × 5^5 × 7^7` is divided by 8, the quotient is n and the remainder is 4.

Because the three integers have mean 7, their sum is `3 × 7 = 21`. For the largest of the three positive integers to be as large as possible the other two need to be as small as possible. Since they are different positive integers, the smallest they can be is 1 and 2. The largest of the three integers is then `21 − (1 + 2) = 18`. So 18 is the largest any of them could be.

The crucial point with this question is that we are not dealing with a flat board, but rather a board with a step, and this means it is possible move from a white square to a white square. So you can reach a black square by moving from white to black to white to white to black.  
^^^

![](/resources/9-35-summer-sums/14-chess-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
The figure shows the part of the layout that is relevant. Some of the squares have been labelled so that we may refer to them. A movement of the ant will be indicated by the sequence of labels of the four squares, in order, that the ant travels to after leaving the square labelled P. For example, QTUV is one such sequence. In this example the ant ends up on the black square V.

The ant starts on a white square. If at each move the colour of the square it is on changes, after four moves it will end up on a white square. So the only way the ant can end up on a black square is if on one of its moves the colour of the square does not change. That is, during its sequence of moves it either moves from T to U, or from U to T, or from W to X, or from X to W.  

We therefore see that the only movements which result in the ant ending up on a black square are  

__QTUR, QTUV, QTUX, QTWX, RUTQ, RUTS, RUTW__ and __RUXW__.  

From the final letters of these sequences we see that there are exactly 6 black squares that the ant can end up on after four moves, namely, Q, R, S, V, W and X.

This question is not that hard to solve algebraically or by drawing some lines and seeing some symmetries. However, I decided to take an extreme version of squeezing one of the triangles and expanding the other, so that we have the following, which has an area which is easy to calculate. This means that the answer is either the shaded area or “more information needed”.

We divide the rectangle into four smaller rectangles by the vertical dashed lines as shown in the figure. It is then evident that the shaded area is the sum of exactly half the area of each of the smaller rectangles.  

Therefore the total shaded area is half the total area of the original rectangle. So the shaded area is `1/2 (3 × 14)` cm<sup>2</sup> = 21 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

We could also solve this question algebraically. We let the top edges of the two shaded triangles have lengths `a` cm and `b` cm, respectively, so that `a + b = 14`. The two shaded triangles have areas `1/2 (a × 3)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 a` cm<sup>2</sup> and `1/2 (b × 3)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 b` cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Hence their total area is

`(3/2 a + 3/2 b)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 (a + b)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 3/2 × 14` cm<sup>2</sup> = 21 cm<sup>2</sup>.

__17.1__ In a sequence, each term after the first two terms is the mean of all the terms which come before that term. The first term is 8 and the tenth term is 26.

What is the second term?

---

Here it is actually a little easier to see what is going on if we think about the general case of a sequence in which every term after the second is the mean of all the terms that come before it.  

Consider a sequence generated by this rule whose first two terms are `a` and `b`. The mean of these terms is `(a + b)/2`, and so the first three terms are  

`a, b, (a + b)/2`.  

The sum of these three terms is the same as the sum of the three terms  

`(a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`  

and it follows that the mean of the first three terms is also (a + b)/2. So the first four terms of the sequence are  

`a, b, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`.  

These have the same sum as the four terms  

`(a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2, (a + b)/2`.

It follows that the mean of the first four terms is also `(a + b)/2` and that therefore this is the fifth term of the sequence, and so on. We thus see that each term of the sequence after the first two is equal to the mean of the first two terms.  

In the sequence we are given in the question the first term is 8 and the tenth term is 26. It follows that 26 is the mean of the first two terms. Hence their sum is 2 × 26 = 52. Since the first term is 8, we deduce that the second term is 52 − 8 = 44.

I did not follow the approach of the solution you will see after you have completed the Parallelogram, but here is something to get you started. If the difference in area is the same for any two stripes, then just consider the two smallest stripes. They make up a sub-triangle that is only a third the size of the whole triangle. And the shaded mini-triangle is half the length, so a quarter of the area of the outlined sub-triangle.

The lines we have added in the figure on the right divide the flag into 15 congruent rectangles and 6 congruent triangles. Let the area of each of the 15 rectangles be `x` cm<sup>2</sup>. The area of each of the 6 congruent triangles is half that of the rectangles, that is, `1/2x` cm<sup>2</sup>.  

The difference between the area of the adjacent vertical stripes of the flag is the area of one of the rectangles.  

From its dimensions, we see that the area of the flag is `1/2 (72 × 24)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= (36 × 24)` cm<sup>2</sup>. It is made up of 15 rectangles, each with area `x` cm<sup>2</sup>, and 6 triangles, each with area `1/2x` cm<sup>2</sup>.  

Therefore  

`15x + 6 (1/2 x) = 36 × 24`,  

that is,  

`18x = 36 × 24`,  

and it follows that  

`x = (36 × 24)/18 = 2 × 24 = 48`.  

Hence the difference between the area of adjacent stripes of the flag is 48 cm<sup>2</sup>.

With `m = 2` and `n = 1`, we have `m + n = 3`, `m − n = 1`, `m × n = 2` and `m ÷ n = 2`. So it is possible for three of the expressions to have values that are prime. [Note that 1 is not a prime, so in this case `m − n` is not prime].  

We now show that this is the best that can be achieved by showing that it is not possible for all four of the expressions to have values that are primes.  

Since `m` and `n` are positive integers with `m > n`, we have `m > 1`. Therefore `m × n` is prime if, and only if, `m` is prime and `n = 1`. Then `m + n = m + 1` and `m − n = m − 1`. Therefore, if all four expressions are primes, `m − 1`, `m` and `m + 1` would be three consecutive primes. However a trio of consecutive positive integers that are all primes does not exist. We conclude that not all four of the expressions can have values that are primes.

The difference between the box, 20 plates, 30 cups and the box, 40 plates, 50 cups, is 20 plates and 20 cups. From the information in the question we see that the extra weight of 20 plates and 20 cups is 8.4 kg − 4.8 kg = 3.6 kg.  

Therefore the weight of 10 plates and 10 cups is `1/2 (3.6)` kg = 1.8 kg.  

If we remove 10 plates and 10 cups from the box, 20 plates and 30 cups we end up with the box, 10 plates and 20 cups. Removing the 10 plates and 10 cups reduces the original weight of 4.8 kg by 1.8 kg. Hence the weight of the box, 10 plates and 20 cups is 4.8 kg − 1.8 kg = 3 kg.

We work out the area that is not shaded and subtract this area from that of the large square.  

The area that is not shaded is made up of the four corner squares and four trapeziums.  

The total area of the squares is, in cm<sup>2</sup>,  

`1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30`.  

We now use the fact that the area of a trapezium is given by the formula  

`1/2 (a + b)h`,

where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides, and `h` is their distance apart.  

The values of `a`, `b` and `h` for the trapeziums `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S`, as labelled in the diagram, can be calculated from the side lengths of the squares, and are shown in the diagram. We therefore have that  

area of `P = 1/2 (1 + 2) × 8 = 12`,  
area of `Q = 1/2 (2 + 3) × 6 = 15`,  
area of `R = 1/2 (3 + 4) × 4 = 14`, and  
area of `S = 1/2 (4 + 1) × 6 = 15`.  

It follows that the total area of the trapeziums is  

`12 + 15 + 14 + 15 = 56`.  

The large square has area `11^2` cm<sup>2</sup> = 121 cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the area of the shaded quadrilateral is, in cm<sup>2</sup>, `121 − 30 − 56 = 35`.

There are 3 choices for the first character, namely `V`, `X` or `P`. There are 10 choices for the second character, namely one of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. Because the second and third characters are different digits, the third character can be any one of the 10 digits, other than the second character. Therefore there are 9 choices for the third character. There is just 1 choice for the fourth character as this is the units digit of the sum of the second and third digits.  

It follows that the total number of voucher codes is `3 × 10 × 9 × 1 = 270`.

__26.1__ A rectangle is placed obliquely on top of an identical rectangle, as shown.  

The area `X` of the overlapping region (shaded more darkly) is one eighth of the total shaded area.  

What fraction of the area of one rectangle is `X`?

* [ ] `2/7`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [x] `2/9`
* [ ] `1/5`
{.col-5}

The rectangles are identical. Therefore they have the same area. Let this area be `Y`.  

It follows that the area of each rectangle that is not part of the overlap is `Y − X`. Hence the total shaded area, made up of the two areas of the rectangles which are not part of the overlap, together with the overlap, is  

`2(Y − X) + X = 2Y − X`.  

We are given that the area of the overlap is one eighth of the total shaded area. Therefore  

`X/(2Y − X) = 1/8`.  

This equation may be rearranged to give  

`8X = 2Y − X`,  

from which it follows that  

`9X = 2Y`,  

and therefore that  

`X/Y = 2/9`.

We form a complete grid inside the large square by extending the sides of the small squares, as shown in the figure. In this way the large square is divided up into 61 small squares, 20 triangles along the edges whose areas are equal to half that of the small squares, and 4 triangles in the corners whose areas are equal to one quarter that of the small squares.

So the area of the large square is equal to that of  

`61 × 1 + 20 × 1/2 + 4 × 1/4 = 72`  

of the small squares. The shaded area is made up of 24 small squares. Therefore the fraction of the large square that is shaded is  

`24/72 = 1/3`.  

[Note that we could save some work by taking advantage of the symmetry of the figure, and just work out which fraction of, say, the top left hand corner of the square is shaded.]

__28.1__ There are 120 different ways of arranging the letters, U, K, M, I and C. All of these arrangements are listed in dictionary order, starting with CIKMU.

Because the sequence UKIMC comes towards the bottom of the list in dictionary order of all 120 arrangements of the letters U, K, M, I, C, we can most easily find its position by listing the arrangements in reverse dictionary order, until we reach UKIMC, as follows  

120 UMKIC  
119 UMKCI  
118 UMIKC  
117 UMICK  
116 UMCKI  
115 UMCIK  
114 UKMIC  
113 UKMCI  
112 UKIMC  

We see from this that UKIMC is the 112th arrangement in the dictionary order list.

__29.1__ In square `RSTU` a quarter-circle arc with centre `S` is drawn from `T` to `R`.  

A point `P` on this arc is 1 unit from `TU` and 8 units from `RU`.

Suppose that `x` is the length of the sides of the square `RSTU`. We need to find the value of `x`.  

We let `K` be the point where the perpendicular from `P` to `RS` meets `RS`, and `L` be the point where the perpendicular from `P` to `ST` meets `ST`, as shown in the figure. Then `PK` has length `x − 1`, and so also does `LS`. Also, `PL` has length `x − 8`.  

Because `PS` is a radius of the quarter circle, its length is the same as that of the sides of the square, namely, `x`.

Therefore `SLP` is a right-angled triangle in which the hypotenuse has length `x`, and the other two sides have lengths `x − 1` and `x − 8`. Hence, by Pythagoras’ Theorem,  

`(x − 1)^2 + (x − 8)^2 = x^2`.  

Multiplying out the squares, we get  

`(x^2 − 2x + 1) + (x^2 − 16x + 64) = x^2`,  

which we can rearrange as  

`x^2 − 18x + 65 = 0`.  

We can factorize the quadratic on the left-hand side of this equation to give the equivalent equation  

`(x − 5)(x − 13) = 0`,  

which has the solutions `x = 5` and `x = 13`. Since `x − 8` is the length of PL and therefore cannot be negative, `x ≠ 5`. Therefore `x = 13`.

We use the notation `△XYZ` for the area of a triangle `XYZ`.  

We let `P`, `Q` and `R` be the vertices of the triangle, and let `S`, `T` and `U` be the points one quarter of the way along each side, as shown in the figure.  

We let `K` and `L` be the points where the perpendiculars from `P` and `T`, respectively, meet `QR`.  

The area of a triangle is half the base multiplied by the height of the triangle. Therefore  

`△PQR = 1/2 (QR × PK)`.

We now obtain an expression for `△TSR`.  

Because S is one quarter of the way along `QR`, `SR = 3/4 QR`.  

In the triangles `PKR` and `TLR`, the angles at `K` and `L` are both right angles, and the angle at `R` is common to both triangles. It follows that these triangles are similar. Therefore  

`TL/PK = TR/PR = 1/4`,  

and hence  

`TL = 1/4PK`.  

It follows that  

`△STR = 1/2 (SR × T L) = 1/2 (3/4 QR × 1/4 PK) = 3/16 (1/2 (QR × PK)) = 3/16 △PQR`.  

Similarly,  

`△TPU = 3/16 △PQR`.  

It follows that the fraction of the area of triangle `PQR` that is shaded is  

`1 − 3/16 − 3/16 = 5/8`.
