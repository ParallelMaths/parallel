* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday night if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1.	Magic Hexagon

Take a look at this video by James Grime and answer the question below.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ How many types of magic hexagon are there?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1 (with 19 elements)
* [x] 2 (with 1 or 19 elements)
* [ ] 3 (with 1, 2 or 3 elements)
* [ ] ∞
{.col-5}

## 2.
<!--- (2003) Q5 --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ What is the value of `2003^2`?

* [ ] 4009
* [ ] 400009
* [ ] 401209
* [ ] 4000009
* [x] 4012009
{.col-5}

---

`(2000 + 3)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 × 2000 × 3 + 3^2 = 4000000 + 12000 + 9 = 4012009`.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
![](/resources/10-28-magic-hexagons/5-diagram.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1__ Lines `AB` and `CD` are parallel and `BC = BD`.  

Given that `x` is an acute angle not equal to 60°, how many other angles in this diagram are equal to `x`?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 5

^^^ hint id=3_1 marks=1
The answer is not 2.

* Angle `BCD` = `x` (vertically opposite angles);  
* Angle `BDC` = angle `BCD` (base angles of isosceles triangle);  
* Angle `ABC` = angle `BCD` (alternate angles);  
* Angle `EBD` = angle `BCD` (alternate angles).

## 4.
<!--- (2003) Q15 --->
::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ Each interior angle of a particular polygon is an obtuse angle which is a whole number of degrees. What is the greatest number of sides the polygon could have?

* [ ] 90
* [ ] 179
* [ ] 180
* [ ] 359
* [x] 360
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=1
In order for the polygon to have the largest number of sides, the internal angle needs to be as large as possible, which is 179°, as the angle has to be a whole number and it cannot be 180° or larger.
^^^

---

As each interior angle of the polygon is a whole number of degrees, the same must apply to each exterior angle. The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is 360° and so the greatest number of sides will be that of a 360-sided polygon in which each interior angle is 179°, thus making each exterior angle 1°.

## 5.
<!--- (2003) Q18 --->
::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ When dates are written using eight digits, eg 06 02 2020, the 20th February 2002 is a palindromic date, since 20 02 2002 has the same digits in the same order when read in reverse.  

The previous palindromic date and the next few all occur in the month of February.  

What will be the next month other than February to have a palindromic date in it?

* [ ] March
* [ ] April
* [ ] October
* [ ] November
* [x] December

---

All palindromic dates this century will fall in February as they will be of the form ab 02 20ba.  

The palindromic dates next century will fall in December as they will be of the form cd 12 21dc and the first of these will be the 10th December 2101, ie 10 12 2101.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
