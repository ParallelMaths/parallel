##About Parallel Primary

Parallel Primary is the latest education initiative from bestselling science author Simon Singh.

We are on a mission to increase the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians. Our other projects include [Parallelograms](/) (free weekly maths problem sheets on a range of interesting maths topics), the [Maths Masterclass programme](https://www.talent-ed.uk/maths-masterclass-tutorials-1){target="_blank"} (small-group online tutorials for high-attaining students) and Monthly Maths Challenge (live webinars for enthusiastic students). They are aimed at secondary students, so Parallel Primary is our first venture designed for younger mathematicians.

We are now inviting up to 1,000 of the most talented and ambitious Year 5 and Year 6 students to join us for 4 interactive maths webinars this June.

__4 weeks of challenging, exciting mathematics__

The sessions will be run by Simon and Countdown champion Junaid Mubeen. We’ve hand-selected a range of questions from the Primary Maths Challenge and other competitions. In exploring these questions, students will develop their problem solving and reasoning skills. We have also lined up a series of more playful ‘Maths Magic’ activities that are sure to stretch and engage students. We use a range of secure audience interaction tools such as live polls and Q&A to keep students actively engaged throughout our sessions.

__For talented and ambitious Year 5 and Year 6 students__

We’re seeking talented and enthusiastic Year 5 and 6 maths students from anywhere in the UK. We are especially keen to reach disadvantaged students who may otherwise lack the opportunities for extracurricular maths development.

__A springboard to future maths programmes__

This summer programme leads on to two longer-term opportunities:

* Year 5 students can progress to our year-round Year 6 programme when it launches this Autumn.
* Year 6 students will be well placed to apply for our Year 7 Masterclass and Monthly Maths Challenge programmes, also available in the next academic year.


##FAQs

__What technology is involved?__
All of our sessions are live streamed on YouTube. The streams are set to ‘Made for Kids’ and, rest assured, the session is designed to safeguard your child’s privacy at all times. If you have trouble accessing YouTube on your device, [take a look at this help page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6159254?hl=en-GB){target="_blank"}.

__Is it compulsory for students to attend all four webinars?__

We would prefer students to attend all four webinars, but we also appreciate that sometimes students will have to miss one or two sessions due to a range of circumstances. We offer each session twice to allow for some flexibility.

__How do I register?__
Parents can register their child from May 5 2022.

Note for teachers: please share this page with parents of students that you think will benefit from the programme. They will need to include the name and email of their maths teacher, which we hope you are happy to provide.
