## About Parallel Primary

Parallel Primary is the latest education initiative from bestselling science author Simon Singh.

We are on a mission to increase the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians. Our other projects include [Parallelograms](/) (free weekly maths problem sheets on a range of interesting maths topics), the [Maths Masterclass programme](https://www.talent-ed.uk/maths-masterclass-tutorials-1){target="_blank"} (small-group online tutorials for high-attaining students) and Monthly Maths Challenge (live webinars for enthusiastic students). They are aimed at secondary students, so Parallel Primary is our first venture designed for younger mathematicians.

We are now inviting up to 1,000 of the most talented and ambitious Year 5 and Year 6 students to join us for 4 interactive maths webinars this June.

### 4 weeks of challenging, exciting mathematics

The sessions will be run by Simon and Countdown champion Junaid Mubeen. We’ve hand-selected a range of questions from the Primary Maths Challenge and other competitions. In exploring these questions, students will develop their problem solving and reasoning skills. We have also lined up a series of more playful ‘Maths Magic’ activities that are sure to stretch and engage students. We use a range of secure audience interaction tools such as live polls and Q&A to keep students actively engaged throughout our sessions.

### For talented and ambitious Year 5 and Year 6 students

We’re seeking talented and enthusiastic Year 5 and 6 maths students from anywhere in the UK. We are especially keen to reach disadvantaged students who may otherwise lack the opportunities for extracurricular maths development.

We would prefer students to attend all four webinars, but we also appreciate that sometimes students will have to miss one or two sessions due to a range of circumstances. We offer each session twice to allow for some flexibility.
