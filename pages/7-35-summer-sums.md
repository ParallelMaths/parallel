# Summer Sums

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s summer and the school year is over (or maybe it’s nearly over), but that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of mathematics. If you are taking mathematics seriously and if you are having fun with it (being serious and having fun can go together), then it is important that you keep the numbers and geometry parts of your brain at least a little bit busy over the summer. I am hoping that your teacher will have set you some holiday work, but on top of that here is a longer than usual Parallelogram.  

Most of the questions are from past Junior Maths Challenge papers that you have seen before, but I have also added a sprinkling of other things to make the Parallelogram (even) more interesting.  

It will take you an hour or two to complete this Parallelogram, so maybe tackle it across three or four sessions... but don’t forget to complete it before term starts.  

And... if you have missed any earlier Parallelograms then the summer is a great time to do some catching up.

Here it is easy just to check the options that are given. A, D and E are the only options in which all four digits are different. Of these, clearly, E is the smallest.

For a complete solution we need to give an argument to show that 1023 really is the smallest four digit positive integer with four different digits. It is easy to do this.

To get the smallest possible number we must use the four smallest digits, 0, 1, 2 and 3. A four digit number cannot begin with a 0. So we must put the next smallest digit, 1, in the thousands place, as a four-digit number beginning with 2 or 3 is larger than one beginning with a 1. For similar reason the
hundreds digit must be the smallest remaining digit, 0. Similarly the tens digit must be 2 and the units digit must be 3.

So the required number is 1023.

## 5. QI : Curious Sporting Loopholes

Mathematics is about rules (e.g., odd plus odd equals even), but it is also about understanding the rules in such detail that you know how to gain an advantage in solving problems. In that spirit, here is a clip from the BBC show “QI” about taking advantage of loopholes in sporting rules.

---

From the information, we see that Amy is to the left of both Ben and Chris. So the three are in the order Amy, Ben, Chris or the order Amy, Chris, Ben.

So Amy is certainly furthest to the left, and the others are all false either in one case or in both.

---

![](/resources/7-35-summer-sums/12-diagram-answer.gif){image align="right"}
As `ST` is parallel to `UV`, `∠PRT = 132°` (corresponding angles).

So `∠PRQ = 48°` (angles on a straight line).

From the exterior angle of a triangle theorem, `∠SQP = ∠QPR + ∠PRQ`, so `x = 134 - 48 = 86°`.

The values of the five expressions are:

* `1/2` × `1/4` = `1/8`

__19.1__ In the following expression each ▲ is to be replaced with either + or - in such a way that the result of the calculation is 100.

123 ▲ 45 ▲ 67 ▲ 89

---

One approach is trial and error, as there are only a few combinations. For example, if it is (+ 45) then it is hard to see how we obtain a result of 100. So, we can then explore (- 45). Following this approach quickly leads you to the correct answer, but there is also a more rigorous and mathematical approach.

The sum is made up of 123 and ± 45, ± 67and ± 89. Suppose that the total of the positive terms in the calculation is `x` and the total of the negative terms is `y`. So `x > 0` and `y < 0`. We need to have that:

`x + y = 100`.
{.text-center}

We also have that:

`x - y = 123 + 45 + 67 + 89 = 324`.
{.text-center}

Adding these equations, we obtain `2x = 424`. So `x = 212` and hence `y = -112`. It is readily seen that `45 + 67 = 112` and that no other combination of 45, 67 and 89 gives a total of 112. So the correct calculation must be `123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100` with 1 plus sign and 2 minus signs. So `p = 1` and
`m = 2`, giving `p - m = -1`.

## 20. Remainder riddle

::: problem id=20_1 marks=3
__20.1__ What is the remainder when you divide `2^100` by `10`?

<input solution="6"/>

---

`2^1 = 2`, therefore the last digit = 2  
`2^2 = 4`, therefore the last digit = 4  
`2^3 = 8`, therefore the last digit = 8  
`2^4 = 16`, therefore the last digit = 6  
`2^5 = 32`, therefore the last digit = 2  
`2^6 = 64`, therefore the last digit = 4  

The pattern for the last digit (which is also the remainder when dividing by 10) is 2, 4, 8, 6, ... repeated.  

Every 4th remainder is 6.  

As 100 is a multiple of 4, then the remainder for `2^100` will be 6.

__21.1.__ The sculpture ‘Cubo Vazado’ [Emptied Cube] by the Brazilian artist Franz Weissmann is formed by removing cubical blocks from a solid cube to leave the symmetrical shape shown.

If all the edges have length 1, 2 or 3, what is the volume of the sculpture?

* [ ] 9

* [x] 12

Consider the sculpture to consist of three layers, each of height 1. Then the volumes of the bottom, middle and top layers are 5, 2, 5 respectively. So the volume of the sculpture is 12.

Alternatively: the sculpture consists of a `3 × 3 × 3` cube from which two `2 × 2 × 2` cubes have been removed. The `2 × 2 × 2` cubes have exactly one `1 × 1 × 1` cube (the cube at the centre of the `3 × 3 × 3` cube) in common. So the volume of the sculpture `= 27 − (2 × 8 - 1) = 12`.

* [ ] (−6, 1)

If `R` is (−5, 4) then `PQ = PR = 6`.  

If `R` is (7, 1) or if `R` is (−6, 1) then `R` lies on the perpendicular bisector of `PQ` (the line `Y = 1`), so in both cases `PR = QR`.  

If `R` is (7, −2), then `QP = QR = 6`.

However if `R` is (−6, −2), then `PQ = 6`, `QR = 7` and `PR > 7`, so triangle `PQR` is scalene.

* [ ] 3

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
{.col-5}

---
Let the length of the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle be `a` cm. Since the triangle has perimeter 20cm, the third side will have length `20 − 2a` cm. Since this must be a positive length, `20 − 2a > 0` and so `a < 10`.

In a triangle, the length of one side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. So `20 − 2a < 2a`.

This gives `20 < 4a` and hence `5 < a`. So, we have `5 < a < 10`.

Therefore, as `a` is a whole number, there are just four possible values for `a`, namely 6, 7, 8 and 9.

So there are four possibilities for the side lengths of the triangle:

* 6, 6, 8;
* 7, 7, 6;
* 8, 8, 4; and
* 9, 9, 2.
