## 1. x + y

“x + y” is a great film about a British teenager, Nathan Ellis, who represents the UK at the International Mathematical Olympiad, and faces challenges that go beyond the universe of numbers. Take a look at this clip, in which Nathan is at a maths training camp and is asked to solve a tricky problem about playing cards. See if you can follow any of Nathan’s answer. His approach is not at all obvious.

The video explains the that rules are to put playing cards in a row, some face up and some face down and “a move consists of turning a face down card face up, and turning over the card immediately to the right.” And let’s say that, as Nathan suggests, face down = 1 and face up = 0. Let’s look at some arrangements involving just 5 cards.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ What is minimum number of moves needed to make this series of cards all become face up: (0 0 0 1 1)

<input type="number" solution="1"/>

---

If you turn over the 1 on the left, then you will also turn over the card on the right – one move.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2.__ What is minimum number of moves needed to make this series of cards all become face up: (0 0 0 1 0)

<input type="number" solution="2"/>

---

You could try (0 0 0 1 0) → (0 0 0 0 1) → (0 0 0 0 0).

Or (0 0 0 1 0) → (0 0 0 1 1) → (0 0 0 0 0).

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3.__ What is minimum number of moves needed to make this series of cards all become face up: (1 1 0 1 1)

<input type="number" solution="2"/>

---

(1 1 0 1 1) → (0 0 0 1 1) → (0 0 0 0 0) or

(1 1 0 1 1 ) → (1 1 0 0 0) → (0 0 0 0 0).

## 2. Solve this sum

This puzzle was tweeted by maths education specialist Drew Foster (@drewfoster0 on Twitter).

![](/resources/9-06-x-y/2-question.jpg){image align="center"}

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ What number is represented by the white circle? If you are stuck then hit the hint. You will lose one mark for (2.1), but you will have a better chance of gaining marks on (2.2) and (2.3).

<input type="number" solution="5"/>

^^^ hint id=2_1
From the column on the right, we know that 3 white circles add up to something that ends with a white circle. A bit of trial error reveals that the only solution is (5 + 5 + 5) = 15. So, in fact, that gives you the answer, but you will still need to think about the value of the red and blue circles.

So, just enter 5 in the box above and you have earned 1 mark (i.e., 2 original marks – 1 hint mark) for very little effort. I am feeling very kind this week. Now get to work on questions 2.2 and 2.3

::: problem id=2_2 marks=1
__2.2.__ What number is represented by the red circle?

::: problem id=2_3 marks=1
__2.3.__ What number is represented by the blue circle?

<input type="number" solution="1"/>

## 3.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2011) Q6 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ When I glanced at my car milometer it showed 24942, a palindromic number. Two days later, I noticed that it showed the next palindromic number.

How many miles did my car travel in those two days?

* [ ] 100
* [x] 110
* [ ] 200
* [ ] 220
* [ ] 1010

---

The only 5-digit palindromic number that begins 249 is 24942, so the next palindromic must be greater than 24999.

The only 5-digit palindromic number beginning 250 is 25052, so this is the next palindromic number after 24942.

We have that 25052 - 24942 = 110, and so the answer is 110.

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ How many more miles must you drive to reach the next palindromic number?

<input type="number" solution="100"/> miles

## 4. Fractions

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ What is `1/2 × 2/1`? Give your answer in its simplest form.

<input solution="1"/>
:::

__4.2__ What is `5/6 + 3/4`? Give your answer in its simplest form.
::: problem id=4_2_0 marks=1
Numerator = <input solution="19"/>
:::

::: problem id=4_2_1 marks=1
Denominator = <input solution="12"/>

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
