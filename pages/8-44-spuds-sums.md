__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Which of these calculations produces a multiple of 5?

* [ ] `1 × 2 + 3 + 4`
* [ ] `1 + 2 × 3 + 4`
* [ ] `1 × 2 + 3 × 4`
* [x] `1 + 2 × 3 × 4`
* [ ] `1 × 2 × 3 × 4`

---
The results of the five calculations are 9, 11, 14, 25, 24 respectively.

__2.1.__  At Spuds-R-Us, a 2.5kg bag of potatoes costs £1.25. How much would one tonne of potatoes cost?

* [ ] £5
* [ ] £20
* [ ] £50
* [ ] £200
* [x] £500
{.col-5}

---

The cost of 1 kg of potatoes is £1.25 ÷ 2.5 = 50p. So the cost of 1 tonne, that is 1000 kg, is 1000 × 50p = £500.

## 3. Is it Better to Walk or Run in the Rain?

MinutePhysics is a great YoutTube channel, so dive in and watch loads of them. But, for now, take a look at this video about running in the rain.

__3.1__ If you are outside in the rain and you want to minimise how wet you get, you should…

* [ ] Stand still

__3.2__ If you are outside in the rain and __don’t have an umbrella__ and you want to minimise how wet you get, you should…

* [ ] Stand still

## 4.
<!--- 2010 (18) --->
::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ Sam's 101st birthday is tomorrow. So Sam's age in years changes from a square number (100) to a prime number (101).

How many times has this happened before in Sam's lifetime?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

The other times that this has happened previously are when Sam's age in years went from 1 to 2; from 4 to 5; from 16 to 17 and from 36 to 37.

_Note that since primes other than 2 are odd, the only squares which need to be checked, other than 1, are of even numbers._

__5.1.__ In the diagram on the right, the number in each box is obtained by adding the numbers in the two boxes immediately underneath.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 300
* [ ] 320
* [ ] 340
* [x] 360
* [ ] More information needed

^^^ hint id=22 marks=2
You do not have any two entries given which lie in the same three-box stack, so instead of working out a particular value, label the box next to 12 as `a`. Now label the box next to 78 with an expression, using the fact that this box plus `a = 90`.
^^^

---

![](/resources/8-44-spuds-sums/22-diagram-answer.gif){image align="right"}
Let the numbers in the boxes be as shown in the diagram.

Then `b = 90 - a`; `c = 12 + a`; `d = b + 78 = 168 - a`.

Also, `e = 90 + c = 102 + a`; `f = 90 + d = 258 − a`.

So `x = e + f = 102 + a + 258 - a = 360`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
