Just trying a few examples 1 + 2 + 3, 2 + 3 + 4, etc will show that the totals are always a multiple of 3.  

This is because the least number and the greatest number, being 1 less and 1 greater respectively than the middle number will have a total of twice the middle.  

The total is therefore always three times that of the middle.
