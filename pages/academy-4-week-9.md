# Euclid Module 4 Week 9 Homework

These homework problems relate to a recent theme you have been covering with your tutor. They are arranged in order of increasing difficulty and the final problem is much more of a challenge than the rest.  

The problems are designed to help you reflect on material from previous tutorial sessions (which you can access on your Academy page).  

Each part of the first question is worth 1 mark and every question after this is worth 2 marks. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if you’ve given the problem some real thought.   

Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. Please remember that completing homework is certainly not a race!  

You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck (particularly with the final problem).  

We will also be running a weekly drop-in homework help tutorial (look out for our emails).  


## 1.

If `a = 15°`, what is the value, in degrees, of angle `h`?

Ange `g` is corresponding to angle `c`.  

Angle `d` is alternate to angle `h`.  

Angle `e` forms a co-interior pair with angle `d`.  

Angle `h` is vertically opposite angle `f`.  

Firstly, `c = a = 15°` as they are vertically opposite angles.  
 
Secondly, `h = 180° − 15° = 165°` as angle `c` and angle `h` form a co-interior pair.

<input type="number" solution="21"/>

Firstly, we calculate the other two angles in the triangle.  

The angle to the right of the `60°` angle is `360° − 90° − 57° − 162° = 51°` using angles around a point sum to `360°`.  

The angle below the `60°` angle is `180° − 51° − 60° = 69°` using angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.  

Finally, we calculate `x = 180° − 90° − 69° = 21°` using angles on a straight line sum to `180°`.

Find the value, in degrees, of angle `x` in the diagram below.

<input type="number" solution="51"/>

^^^ hint id=3_1_1 marks=1
Begin by calculating the third angle in the triangle and then consider another angle at `C` and how it relates to `x`.  
^^^

---

Firstly, we calculate the `180° − 17° − 34° = 129°` angle using angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.  

Secondly, we calculate the `180° − 129° = 51°` angle using angles on a straight line sum to `180°`.  

Finally, `x = 51°` as corresponding angles are equal.

Firstly, we calculate the `180°  −  17°  −  34° = 129°` angle using angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.  

Secondly, we calculate the `180° − 129° = 51°` angle using angles on a straight line sum to `180°`.  

Finally, `x = 51°` as corresponding angles are equal.

## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
Find the sum, in degrees, of the three marked angles in the diagram below.  

[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]  
  
![](/resources/academy-4-week-9/5-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"} 

<input type="number" solution="53"/>

^^^ hint id=5_1_1 marks=1
Consider the sum of the angles around each vertex of the triangle. 
^^^

---

To calculate the sum of the three marked angles we observe that if we were to also include the three angles in the triangle, then we would have a full turn around each vertex of the triangle for a total of `3 × 360° = 1080°`.  

This means that the sum of the three marked angles is `3 × 360° − 180° = 900°`.

Given that in the diagram on the below the triangle `PQR` is isosceles with `PQ = PR`, find the value, in degrees,  of angle `x`.  

[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]  
  
![](/resources/academy-4-week-9/6-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"} 

<input type="number" solution="53"/>

^^^ hint id=6_1_1 marks=1
You should start by calculating the angles in Triangle `TUR`.   
^^^

--- 
Firstly, `∠RTU = 180° - ∠STR = 180° - 120° = 60°` since `S`, `T` and `U` lie on a straight line, `∠STU = 180°`.  
  
Secondly, `∠TUR = 180° - ∠TUQ = 180° - 95° = 85°` since `Q`, `U` and `R` lie on a straight line, `∠QUR = 180°`.  
 
Thirdly, `∠TRU = 180° - ∠RTU - ∠TUR = 180° - 60° - 85° = 35°` since the sum of angles in Triangle `TUR` is `180°`.  
  
Fourthly, `∠PQR = ∠PRQ = 35°` since Triangle `PQR` is isosceles and `PQ=PR`.  
  
Finally, `x° = 180° - ∠PQR - ∠PRQ = 180° - 35° - 35° = 110°`.
