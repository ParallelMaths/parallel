# Prime Numbers (and their buddy, one)

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ Which important theorem excludes 1 from being considered a prime number?

* [ ] The Fundamental Theorem of Analysis
* [ ] The Fun Theorem of Emental
* [x] The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ How would 42 be written as a product of primes?

* [ ] 6 × 7
* [ ] 1 × 2 × 21
* [x] 2 × 3 × 7
* [ ] 2 × 21

## 2. Primes, squares and cubes

Primes, Square Numbers and Cube Numbers are the gems of the number world!  

As a quick reminder:  

if you multiply a number by itself you get a square number, 4 × 4 = 16, so 16 is square.  

If you multiply by itself again it is now a cube number 4 × 4 × 4 = 64, so 64 is a cube.  

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ How many prime numbers are there between 1 and 20 (including 1 and 20)

* [ ] 7
* [x] 8
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ How many square numbers are there between 1 and 20 (including 1 and 20)

* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 20
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_3 marks=2
__2.3__ Are there more prime numbers or square numbers in existence?

* [ ] Prime Numbers
* [ ] Square Numbers
* [x] There is an infinite amount of both Prime and Square Numbers
:::

::: problem id=2_4 marks=2
__2.4__ Can you find a positive number which is one bigger than a square number, but one less than a cube number? (There is only one out there, but it is less than 50.)
<input type="number" solution="26"/>

---

26 is the answer, because it is between 5 × 5 and 3 × 3 × 3.

## 3. Parallel Circles

Parallel Circles, our weekly online maths sessions with bestselling science author Simon Singh, Countdown champion Junaid Mubeen and a range of guest speakers, start next week.  

We have [Circles designed for each Level of Parallel](/circles), and the best session for you to join is our Level 1 Parallel Circle.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
__3.1__ Will you be joining the Parallel Circle next week?  

(Note: there is a right answer to this question!)

* [x] Yes, I'll almost certainly be there!
* [ ] No, I'm much too busy for all that extra maths!

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
