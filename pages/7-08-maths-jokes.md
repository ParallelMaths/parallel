## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
The difference between `1/3` of a certain number and `1/4` of the same number is 3.  

What is that number?

* [ ] A) 24
* [x] B) 36
* [ ] C) 48
* [ ] D) 60
* [ ] E) 72
{.col-5}

Since `1/3 - 1/4 = (4 - 3)/12 = 1/12`

it follows that `1/12` th of the number is 3. Therefore the number is `12 × 3 = 36`.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
In the expression 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 each □ is to be replaced by either + or ×.  

What is the largest value of all the expressions that can be obtained in this way?

* [ ] A) 10
* [ ] B) 14
* [ ] C) 15
* [ ] D) 24
* [x] E) 25

In general, we obtain a larger number by multiplying two positive integers together than by adding them. The only exceptions are when one of the positive integers is `1`, because `1 + n > 1 × n`, and when both are `2`, because `2 + 2 = 2 × 2`.  

Therefore to obtain the largest possible value we need to replace the first □ with + but the other two with ×. This leads us to the answer `1 + 2 × 3 × 4 = 1 + 24 = 25`.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
Which of the following is divisible by all of the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive?

* [ ] A) 23 × 34
* [ ] B) 34 × 45
* [x] C) 45 × 56
* [ ] D) 56 × 67
* [ ] E) 67 × 78
{.col-5}

It is easy to rule out four of the options using the fact that a product of integers is divisible by a prime number `p` if, and only if, at least one of the integers making up the product is divisible by p.

Using this we see that, since neither 23 nor 34 is a multiple of 3, it follows that 23 × 34 is not a multiple of 3, since neither 34 nor 45 is a multiple of 7, 34 × 45 is not a multiple of 7, since neither 56 nor 67 is a multiple of 5, 56 × 67 is not a multiple of 5, and, similarly, 67 × 78 is not a multiple of 5.

This rules out the options A, B, D and E. In the context of the JMC this is enough for us to be able to conclude that option C is the correct answer.

However, for a full solution, we would need to check directly that 45 × 56 is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 10. This is straightforward.

Every integer is divisible by 1. Since 45 is divisible by 3, 5 and 9, so also is 45 × 56. Since 56 is divisible by 2, 4, 7 and 8, so also is 45 × 56. Since 45 × 56 is divisible both by 2 and by 3, which have no common factor, it is also divisible by 6. Since 45 × 56 is divisible by both 2 and by 5, which have no common factor, it is also divisible by 10.

Therefore 45 × 56 is divisible by all the integers from 1 to 10, inclusive.

The diagram shows a pyramid made up of 30 cubes, each measuring 1m × 1m × 1 m.  

What is the total surface area of the whole pyramid (including its base)?

* [ ] A) 30 m<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] B) 62 m<sup>2</sup>
* [x] C) 72 m<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] D) 152 m<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] E) 180 m<sup>2</sup>

The surface area that can be seen by looking up from below the pyramid is that of 4 × 4 = 16
squares each measuring 1m × 1 m. So the surface area of the base is 16 m<sup>2</sup>.  

The view looking down from above the pyramid is shown in the diagram. The surface area that can be seen is made up of a complete 1m × 1m square, some three-quarter squares and some half squares. Without adding these up, we can see that the surface area is also 16 m<sup>2</sup>.

The view from each of the four sides is made up of a pyramid of 10 squares whose surface area is 10 m<sup>2</sup>.  

Therefore, the total surface area is 2 × 16 m<sup>2</sup> + 4 × 10 m<sup>2</sup> = 72 m<sup>2</sup>.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=5
The four straight lines in the diagram are such that `VU = VW`. The sizes of `∠UXZ`, `∠VYZ` and `∠VZX` are `x°, y° `and `z°`.

![](/resources/7-08-maths-jokes/25-triangle.jpg){image align="center"}  

Which of the following equations gives `x` in terms of `y` and `z`?

* [ ] A) `x = y − z`
* [ ] B) `x = 180 − y − z`
* [ ] C) `x = y − z/2`
* [ ] D) `x = y + z − 90`
* [x] E) `x = (y − z)/2`

---

Because `VU = VW`, the triangle `VUW` is isosceles and so `∠VUW` and `∠VWU` are equal.  

Because they are vertically opposite `∠VWU` and `∠YWX` are equal.  

Therefore `∠VUW`, `∠VWU` and `∠YWX` are all equal. We let the size of these three angles be `t°`, as marked on the diagram.

![](/resources/7-08-maths-jokes/25-triangle-answer.jpg){image align="center"}  

We now apply the _Exterior Angle Theorem_ in turn to the exterior angle, `∠VUW` of triangle `UZX` and the exterior angle `∠ZYW` of triangle `WYX`. This gives `t = z + x` and `y = t + x`.  

Therefore, using the first equation to substitute `z + x` for `t` in the second equation, we have `y = (z + x) + x = z + 2x`.  

Hence, by rearranging the last equation, `2x = y − z`.  

By dividing both sides of the last equation by 2, we conclude that `x = (y − z)/2`.

*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
