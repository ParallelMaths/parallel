__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Flipping good maths

Pi, Sandwich Theorem, Nugget Numbers... being a mathematician can make you hungry! But there’s always room for more maths.  

Watch this video where Katie Steckles explains the Maths behind flipping pancakes.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What is the maximum amount of flips needed to re-order a stack of 5 pancakes?

<input type="number" solution="5"/> flips
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ For three pancakes, we need three flips. Four pancakes need four flips.

Exactly how many flips are needed to reorder 20 pancakes?

* [ ] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 21
* [x] Nobody knows... yet
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ Katie showed us the new and improved formula to calculate the “upper bound” for a pancake number is `(18n)/11`, or `18 × (the number of pancakes)/11`.

What is the upper bound for 22 pancakes?

<input type="number" solution="36"/>

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1
Try putting 22 into the formula, in place of "the number of pancakes"
^^^

Using substitution `18 × 22 / 11 = 36`

## 2. Another pancake puzzle

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ You flip over a pancake to find some parts have been charred! What fraction of the pancake is burned?

![](/resources/6-09-pancakes/1-pancake.png){image align="center"}

* [x] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/10`
{.col-4}

---

Each burned part has an equivalent perfectly cooked part, so half of the pancake is burned.
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ You are a hungry mathematician and you are offered either one pancake with an 12cm diameter, or two pancakes with a 6cm diameter.

Assuming you would like as much pancake as possible, which option should you choose?

* [x] One 12cm pancake
* [ ] Two 6cm pancakes
* [ ] Either, its the same amount of pancake

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
