# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 13_ Snake Mathematics

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

There are only 3 more Parallelograms this year, as we will be starting our summer break at half-term. If you score highly enough in the last 4 Parallelograms (12, this one, 14 & 15) by June 1, __then you will receive a Parallel certificate__. An average of more than 40% in these four Parallelograms wins a bronze certificate, then 60% or more wins silver and 80% or more wins gold.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
* Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
* Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	Vi Hart snake bonanza

This video shows the very amazing Vi Hart playing with flexible chain snakes. By the way, mathematicians love to just play with things, because mathematicians are bit odd and often interesting ideas emerge out of playing.

Watch the video and then have a go at the following questions.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ Which ‘slither’ is not valid?

* [ ] RLRRLLRRL
* [ ] RLRRLRRLL
* [x] RRRRRRRR
* [ ] SRSSSRSSR
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ If you start off with one snake, removing its head results in two new heads growing in its place. If you chop off all the existing heads, then two new heads will grow in their places. This carries on until you have a snake with 32 heads. How many heads did you have to cut off to get to this situation?

<input solution="31"/>

---

One approach is to draw a snake, then draw a line through it and draw two more heads near it. Then carry on until you get 32 heads and look back and you will see that you have crossed out 31 heads. Another way to think about it is to say: “Every time the snake loses 1 head, it actually ends up 1 more head than it started with. So, to get from 1 to 32 heads, I will have to cut off 31 heads.”

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1.__ Peter has three times as many sisters as brothers. His sister Louise has twice as many sisters as brothers. How many children are there in the family?

* [ ] 15
* [x] 13
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 5

---

Suppose Peter has `b` brothers and hence `3b` sisters. So, including Peter, there are `b + 1` boys and `3b` girls in the family. So Louise has `b + 1` brothers and `3b − 1` sisters. Since Louise has twice as many sisters as brothers, `3b − 1 = 2(b + 1)`. This equation is equivalent to `3b − 1 = 2b + 2`. So `b = 3` and there are 4 boys and 9 girls in the family, making 13 children altogether.

## 3. Stephen Hawking (1942 – 2018)

When the cosmologist Stephen Hawking died, journalists discussed his incredible scientific achievements, and they also emphasised how his life had inspired people all over the world.  

Here are three quotes from Stephen Hawking, that might inspire you.  

__“Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.”__

__“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.”__

__“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”__

## 4. Homonyms

This is a relatively long video about words. It’s eleven minutes long and it is presented by the YouTube sensation Michael Stevens.

You might wonder, why have a video about words in a mathematics challenge? First, I think Stevens analyses words in very mathematical way, placing them within a Venn diagram. Second, if you are curious about mathematics, then I hope you are also curious about loads of other things, including words and language.

Watch, and have a go at the questions below.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1.__ “Poecilonym” is means the same as:

* [ ] homonym
* [ ] homophone
* [x] synonym
* [ ] simile
* [ ] metaphor

::: problem id=4_2 marks=2
__4.2.__ Which two words are homographs?

* [x] record & record
* [ ] blue & blew
* [ ] buy & purchase
* [ ] diarrhoea & diarroea
* [ ] maths & mathematics

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
![](/resources/8-13-snake-mathematics/5-dice-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__5.1.__ On standard dice the total number of pips on each pair of opposite faces is 7. Two standard dice are placed in a stack, as shown, so that the total number of pips on the two touching faces is 5.

What is the total number of pips on the top and bottom faces of the stack?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [x] 9

---

The total number of pips on the top and bottom faces of the two dice is 7 + 7 = 14. As there is a total number of 5 pips on the touching faces, there are 14 - 5 = 9 pips altogether on the top and bottom faces of the stack.

## 6. Pick a card

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1.__ This question was inspired by video created by the psychologist Professor Richard Wiseman. I am holding two red cards and two black cards face down. You have to pick two of the cards. If you pick both of the black cards, then you win £4. By the way, it costs you £1 to play the game. Which of these statements is true?

* [ ] This is a fair game, as you will win one time in four.
* [ ] This game is great for you, as you will win money in the long run.
* [x] This game is a con, because you will lose money in the long run.

---

The game is a con, as explained in Professor Wiseman’s video below.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram. Remember you will also have to have completed last week’s Parallelogram and the final two in order to win your Parallel certificate.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,
Simon.
