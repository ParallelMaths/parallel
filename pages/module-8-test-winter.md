## 1.    
::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the highest common factor of `315` and `660`?

<input type="number" solution="15"/>  

---

`315 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 7`.  
`660 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 11`.  

So the highest common factor is `3 × 5 = 15`.

In the diagram below, what is the value of `x`?

![](/resources/module-8-test-winter/2-symmetricalhexagon.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="140"/>  

---

Angles in a hexagon sum to `720°` and so  `2x = 720  –  (130 + 130 + 90 + 90) = 280`.  

This means `x = 280/2 = 140`.

## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If the ratio of boys to girls in a year group is `5:4` and there are `88` girls, how many students are there altogether?  

<input type="number" solution="198"/>  

---

`88` girls represent `4/(5+4) = 4/9` of the total number of students.  

So the total number of students is `9/4 × 88 = 198`.

## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which one of the below numbers is prime?  

* [ ] `12221`
* [ ] `34443`
* [ ] `56665`
* [x] `78887`
* [ ] `91119`
{.col-5}

---

Using divisibility rules we have:  

* `12221` is a multiple of `11`
* `34443` is a multiple of `9`
* `56665` is a multiple of `5`
* `90009` is a multiple of `3`  

This means `78887` must be the prime number.  
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
What is the value of each interior angle of a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon)?  

<input type="number" solution="150"/>  

---

The general formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is:  

`180°  × (n − 2)/n`  

For an octagon, we substitute in `n = 8` to get an interior angle of:  

`180°  × 10/12 = 180°  × 5/6 = 150°`

## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is largest?

* [ ] `(-1/3)^4`
* [x] `(1/2)^7`
* [ ] `(-1/8)^2`
* [ ] `(1/4)^3`
* [ ] `(1/9)^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are  

* `1/81`
* `1/128`
* `1/64`
* `1/64`
* `1/81`  

The smallest of these is `1/128`.  
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
The mean of the set `(3, 4, 5, 6, x, x)` is `10`.  

What is the value of `x`?  

<input type="number" solution="21"/>  

---

The total of all the numbers will be `6 × 10 = 60`.  

So, `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + x + x = 60` which simplifies to `2x = 42`.  

This means `x = 21`.  
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability that you get at least one Head and at least one Tail?  

* [ ] `1/8`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `3/4`
* [ ] `1`
{.col-5}

---

We will consider the complement, which is all Heads or all Tails, and subtract from `1`.  

There are two ways this could happen: three Heads or three Tails.  

p(3 Heads) = `1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`.  

Similarly, p(3 Tails) = `1/8`.  

So, the probability of getting either of these outcomes is `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`.  

This means that the probability of at least one Head and at least one Tail is `1  −  1/4 = 3/4`.  
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
A square has an integer edge length `x` cm where `x > 1`.  

It is cut into `1` cm by `1` cm smaller squares.  

The small squares along the edges of the large square are then painted red, and the remaining small squares are painted blue.  

The number of blue squares is one more than the number of red squares.  
 
What is the value of `x`?  

<input type="number" solution="7"/>  

---

There are `4x  -  4` red squares and `(x  -  2)^2` blue squares.  

The number of blue squares is one more than the number of red squares and so `(x  -  2)^2 = 4x  -  4 + 1`.  

Expanding and simplifying gives `x^2  -  4x + 4= 4x  -  3`, and rearranging this leads to `x^2  -  8x + 7 = 0`.  

We can factorise to give `(x  -  1)(x  -  7) = 0`, and so `x = 1` or `x = 7`.

As we are told that `x > 1` in the question, we must have `x = 7`. 
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
Ada and Bella have a combined age of `90`.  

In `15` years time, Ada’s age will be twice Bella’s age.  

What is the difference between their current ages?  


<input type="number" solution="40"/>  

---

Let Ada’s current age be `a` and Bella’s current age be `b`.  

Then `a + b = 90` (#).  

In `15` years time, Ada will be `a + 15` and Bella will be `b + 15`, so `a + 15 = 2(b + 15)`.  

Expanding and rearranging gives `a = 2b + 15`.  

Substituting this into (#) gives `(2b + 15) + b = 90`.  

Rearranging gives `3b = 75`, so `b = 25`.  

Rearranging (#) and substituting `b = 25` gives `a = 90  -  25 = 65`.  

Finally, `a  -  b = 65  -  25 = 40`.

## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
In the diagram below, it is given that each line segment is the same length, the three red angles are all equal and the three purple angles are all `200°`.  

What is the value of `∠BAE`?  

![](/resources/module-8-test-winter/11-hexagon.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="50"/>  

---

Triangle `AEC` is equilateral as all its sides will be equal in length due to the symmetry of the diagram.  

This means `∠CAE = 60°` and `∠BAE = 60°  −  ∠CAB`.  

Triangle `CAB` is isosceles and `∠ABC = 360°  −  200°  = 160°` as angles around a point sum to `360°`.  

`∠CAB = ∠BCA = (180°  −  160°)/2 = 10°` as base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and angles in a triangle sum to `180°`.  

Finally, `∠BAE = 60°  −  10°  = 50°`.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
A square is cut into two pieces by a straight line passing through one corner, as shown below.  

Given that  Area `X`  :  Area `Y ` is `3 : 5`,  what is the value of `a/b`?  

![](/resources/module-8-test-winter/12-square.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="3"/>  

---

`X` is a triangle with an area of `1/2a(a + b)`.  

`Y` is a trapezium with an area of `1/2(a + 2b)(a + b)`.  

Given that  Area `X`  :  Area `Y ` is `3 : 5`, this means that `(1/2a(a + b))/(1/2(a + 2b)(a + b)) = 3/5` which simplifies to `a/(a + 2b) = 3/5`.  

Rearranging gives `5a = 3(a + 2b)` and then expanding the brackets gives `5a = 3a + 6b`.  

Collecting like terms gives `2a = 6b`, which leads to `a/b = 6/2 = 3`.
:::


## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
What is the smallest positive integer that when multiplied by `3024` gives a perfect cube?  

<input type="number" solution="196"/>  

---

Let `x` be the smallest such positive integer.  

The prime factorisation of `3024` is `2^4 × 3^3 × 7`.  

The smallest cube number with a factor of `3024` is `2^6 × 3^3 × 7^3`, as the exponent of each prime factor must be a multiple of three.  

So `x = (2^6 × 3^3 × 7^3)/(2^4 × 3^3 × 7) = 2^2 × 7^2 = 196`.  

:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
The five-digit number '`a226b`', where `a` and `b` are non-zero single digits, is divisible by `44`.  

What the largest possible value of `a + b`?  

<input type="number" solution="17"/>  

---
`44` can be factorised as `4 × 11`, which means that the five-digit number must be divisible by `4` and by `11`.  

Using the divisibility rule for `4`, we know that the two-digit number `6b` must be a multiple of `4`.  

This means that `b` must be `4` or `8` (as it is a non-zero single digit).  

To be divisible by `11`, the difference between the sum of digits in even positions and the sum of digits in odd positions is divisible by `11`.  

So `(a + 2 + b)  −  (2 + 6) = 11k` for some integer `k`.  

If `b = 4`, then `a = 11k + 2` and as `a` is a  non-zero single digit we must have `a = 2` (when `k = 0`).  

If `b = 8`, then `a = 11k  −  2` and as `a` is a non-zero single digit we must have `a = 9` (when `k = 1`).  

The largest possible value for `a + b = 9 + 8 = 17`.

## 15.

![](/resources/module-8-test-winter/15-shape.jpg){image align="right"}
The diagram shows a square with sides of length `a`. The shaded part of the square is bounded by a semicircle and two quarter-circle arcs.  

What is the shaded area?  

* [ ] `πa^2/8`
* [x] `a^2/2`
* [ ] `πa^2/2`
* [ ] `a^2/4`
* [ ] `πa^2/4`

---

If the semicircle is cut into two quarter-circles, these can be placed next to the other shaded region to fill up half the square.  

Hence the shaded area is half of the area of the square, namely `a^2/2`.

## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
One-eights of the guests at a wedding were children.  

Three-sevenths of the adult guests were men.  

What fraction of the wedding guests were adult women?  

* [x] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/7`
* [ ] `3/7`
{.col-5}

---

Seven-eights of all the guests were adults, of which three-sevenths were men, so the fraction of guests who were adult women equals `7/8 × 4/7 = 1/2`.

## 17.
::: problem id=17_1 marks=1
Three inhabitants of the planet Zog met in a crater and counted each other's ears.  

Iimi said, "I can see exactly `8` ears"; Dimi said, "I can see exactly `7` ears"; Timi said, "I can see exactly `5` ears".  

None of them could see their own ears.  

How many ears does Timi have?  

* [ ] `2`
* [ ] `4`
* [x] `5`
* [ ] `6`
* [ ] `7`
{.col-5}

---

The aliens say they can see `8, 7, 5` ears respectively, but each ear has been seen by two aliens, so is counted twice.  

Hence the total number of ears is `1/2(8 + 7 + 5) = 10` ears.  

Each alien can see all ten ears except its own.  

Timi sees `5` ears, so has `10  -  5 = 5` ears.

## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
Four brothers have different heights.  

Tobias is shorter than Victor by the same amount by which he is taller than Peter.   

Oscar is shorter than Peter by the same amount as well.  

Tobias is `184` cm tall, and the average height of all four brothers is `178` cm.  

How tall is Oscar?

* [x] `160` cm
* [ ] `166` cm
* [ ] `172` cm
* [ ] `184` cm
* [ ] `190` cm
{.col-5}

---

Let `k` cm be the different between the heights.  

Then the heights in cm are: Tobias 184, Victor `184 + k`, Peter `184  -  k`, and Oscar `184  -  2k`.  

The mean is `178`, so `1/4 (184 + 184 + k + 184  -  k + 184  -  2k) = 178`.  

Hence `4 × 184  -  2k = 4 × 178`, giving `2k = 4 × 184  -  4 × 178 = 4 × 6 = 24`. Hence `k = 12`.  

Therefore Oscar's height in cm is `184  -  2 × 12 = 160` cm.

Maja decided to enter numbers into the cells of a 3 × 3 grid.  

She wanted to do this in such a way that the numbers in each of the four 2 × 2 grids that form part of the 3 × 3 grid have the same totals.  

She has already written numbers in three of the corner cells, as shown in the diagram.  

Which number does she need to write in the bottom right corner?

Let the numbers around the top left cell be `a`, `b`, and `c` as shown.  

Then the sum of the top left 2 × 2 square (and hence _all_ the 2 × 2 squares) is `a + b + c + 3`.  

The top right 2 × 2 square already contains `a` and `b` and 1, so the middle right cell must contain `c + 2`.  

The bottom left 2 × 2 square contains `b + c + 2`, so the bottom middle cell is `a + 1`.  

The bottom right 2 × 2 square already contains `a + b + c + 3`, so the missing value is zero.  

There are many ways to complete the grid; one way is shown here.

Maria chooses two digits, `a` and `b`, and uses them to make a six-digit number '`ababab`'.  

Which of the following is always a factor of numbers formed in this way?  

* [ ] `2`
* [ ] `5`
* [x] `7`
* [ ] `9`
* [ ] `11`
{.col-5}

---

Let '`ab`' be the two-digit number with digits `a` and `b`, then the six-digit number '`ababab`' = `ab × 10101 = ab × 3 × 7 × 13 × 37`, so is always divisible by `3, 7, 13` and `37`.  

But it is only divisible by `2, 5, 9` or `11` if '`ab`' is.
