# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 12_ The North Pole Riddle

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

There are only 4 more Parallelograms this year, as we will be starting our summer break at half-term. If you score highly enough in these last 4 Parallelograms (#12, #13, #14, #15) and complete them by June 1 then you will receive a Parallel certificate. An average of more than 40% in these four Parallelograms wins a bronze certificate, then 60% or more wins silver and 80% or more wins gold.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
* Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
* Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	The North Pole riddle – the genius version

This video is titled “Elon Musk’s favorite interview question”, and it explores in great depth a question that we have covered in two recent Parallelograms. By the way, if you have not heard of Elon Musk, he studied physics at university and he is now labelled the real life Iron Man because he has built a business empire based on developing incredible technology – everything from batteries to rockets. In fact, the second video shows Elon Musk in a cameo in the “Iron Man 2” movie.

## 2. Changing the world

![](/resources/8-12-north-pole/2-steve-jobs.jpg){image align="right"}
Scientists and engineers like Elon Musk are literally changing the world... almost certainly for the better. If you also want to change the world then studying mathematics and then becoming an engineer or scientist is probably a very good path to follow.

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft have changed the way we communicate with each other and the way we appreciate art and music... indeed they have changed the way we live our lives.

Once upon a time, Steve Jobs wanted to persuade the head of Pepsi to join him at Apple, when it was a relatively small company. The head of Pepsi could see no reason why he should leave a global giant like Pepsi to join the relatively small Apple Corporation, but Jobs won him over by saying: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?”

Studying mathematics is a stepping stone to changing the world.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__ After tennis training, Andy collects twice as many balls as Roger and five more than
Maria. They collect 35 balls in total. How many balls does Andy collect?

* [ ] 20
* [ ] 19
* [ ] 18
* [x] 16
* [ ] 8

---

Suppose that Andy collects `x` balls. Since Andy collects twice as many balls as Roger, Roger
collects `1/2 x` balls. Andy collects five more balls than Maria. So Maria collects `x − 5` balls. So between them, Andy, Roger and Maria collect `x + 1/2 x + (x - 5) = 35` balls. They collect 35 balls in total.

Therefore `x + 1/2 x + (x - 5) = 35`

Multiplying this equation by 2 gives `2x + x + 2x - 10 = 70`

This is equivalent to `5x = 80`.

It follows that `x = 16`.

_Note:_ As we are asked for the number of balls that Andy collects, it is natural to begin the problem by letting `x` be this number. However, we see then see that this leads to an equation which includes a fraction. If you look ahead, you might prefer to let the number of balls that Roger collects be `x`.

Then Andy collects `2x` balls and Maria collects `2x − 5` balls.

We then obtain the equation: `2x + x + (2x - 5) = 35` with no fractions in it.

This equation is equivalent to `5x = 40`, from which we deduce that `x = 8`.

This calculation is easier that the one we gave above, but, if you use this method, you need to remember that the answer we are asked for is `2x` and not just `x`.

## 4. As I was going to St Ives

The action movie Die Hard With A Vengeance has a plot in which the two heroes McClane and Carver (played by Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson) have to solve a series of riddles in order to save the city from the evil villain Simon Gruber.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1.__ Have a go at this 200-year-old riddle featured in the film:

_As I was going to St. Ives I met a man with seven wives,  
Each wife had seven sacks, each sack had seven cats,  
Each cat had seven kits: kits, cats, sacks and wives,  
How many were going to St. Ives?_

(BTW, make sure you check the answer sheet when it is available, which will include a clip from Die Hard With  A Vengeance.)

<input solution="1"/>

---

Lots of people give the answer 2,801 (because there is 1 man + 7 wives + 49 sacks + 343 cats + 2,401 kittens). However, the answer is 1, because the rhyme starts with “As I was going to St Ives, I met...”, so only the “I” was going to St Ives, because everyone else was going the other way. Here is how the riddle was solved in the movie.

In fact, I am not sure Samuel L. Jackson is right when he is trying to work out the number of items going away from St Ives. Luckily, in the Sesame Street clip below there is a much better and clearer explanation

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1.__ Two identical rulers are placed together, as shown (not to scale).

![](/resources/8-12-north-pole/5-rulers-question.jpg){image align="center"}

Each ruler is exactly 10 cm long and is marked in centimetres from 0 to 10. The 3 cm
mark on each ruler is aligned with the 4 cm mark on the other.

The overall length is `L` cm. What is the value of `L`?

* [x] 13
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17
{.col-5}

---

The distance between the 4 cm mark and the 10 cm mark at the end of the ruler is (10 - 4) cm = 6 cm.

The overall length is made up of the length on each ruler from the 4 cm mark to the 10 cm mark, plus the length from the 3 cm mark to the 4 cm mark. This latter distance is 1 cm.

So, `L = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13`.

## 6. More Möbius

Last week’s Parallelogram looked at the strange properties of Möbius loops. If you recall, making a Möbius loop involves taking a strip of paper, forming a loop, then making half a twist in one end, and finally joining the two ends with sticky tape. If you follow that process, you will create an object that only has one side. Every piece of paper, of course, is supposed to have two sides – a top and a bottom, or maybe a back and a front. However, the Möbius loop has only one side! (By the way, a Möbius loop is sometimes called a Möbius strip or a Möbius band.)

This is a terrific video by the terrific Vi Hart, who explores the wonders of Möbius loops by making them from something called “Fruit by the Foot”.

By all means watch it to the end, but it gets a bit (only a bit) complicated after 2 minutes 30 seconds.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram. Remember you will also have to complete next week’s Parallelogram and the final two in order to win your Parallel certificate.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,

## Additional Stuff

* This clip is from the Numberphile series and is about Klein bottles, featuring the amazing Cliff Stoll. I can sit and watch him talk about mathematics all day. He also has lots of other interests. For example, in 1986 he investigated and captured the computer hacker Markus Hess, who was working for the Russian KGB and trying to breach American military security.
