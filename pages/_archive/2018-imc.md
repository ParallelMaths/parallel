* [ ] 0

We begin by recalling the definition of a prime:  

A positive integer `n` is said to be prime if `n ≠ 1` and the only divisors of `n` are `1` and `n`.  

It follows from the definition that 1 is not prime. It is easy to see that 11 is prime. Since `111 = 3 × 37`, it follows that 111 is not prime. Since `1111 = 11 × 101`, it follows that 1111 is not prime.  

Therefore just one of the given integers is prime.

Let the vertices of the kite be labelled as shown.  

The question tells us that the triangles `PQR` and `PRS` are isosceles. It follows that `∠QRP = ∠RQP = x°` and that `∠SRP = ∠RSP = x°`. Hence `∠SRQ = 2x°`.  

The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360°. Therefore, from the quadrilateral `PQRS` we have  

`x° + x° + 2x° + x° = 360°`.  

Therefore `5x° = 360°` and hence `x = 72`.

Because the integer closest to `7 + 12/13` is 8, we deduce that `26/206` is approximately equal to `1/8`.

* [ ] 9 cm<sup>2</sup>

A quick solution goes as follows:  

Clearly the four triangles in the corners of the larger square are congruent, and so have the same area. The squares have perimeters of lengths 20 cm and 28 cm. Hence their side lengths are 5 cm and 7 cm, so their areas are 52 cm<sup>2</sup> = 25 cm<sup>2</sup> and 72 cm<sup>2</sup> = 49 cm<sup>2</sup>. The area of the shaded region is one quarter of the difference between the areas of the squares. So the area of the shaded region is `1/4 (49 − 25)` cm<sup>2</sup> = 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

However, for a full solution we need to spell out in detail how we know that the four triangles are congruent. We give two methods for doing this.

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/8-square-answer1.jpg){image align="right"}
__Method 1__  

We let `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S` be the vertices of the larger square, and `T`, `U`, `V` and `W` be the vertices of the smaller square, arranged as shown in the figure.  

Because `PQRS` is a square, `∠TQU = 90°`. Therefore, applying the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180° to triangle `TQU`, we have `∠QTU + ∠TUQ + 90° = 180°`. Hence,  

`∠TUQ = 90° − ∠QTU`. (1)  

Because `TUVW` is a square, `∠UTW = 90°`. Therefore, applying the fact that the sum of the angles on a line is 180° to the angles at `T`, we have `∠QTU + 90° + ∠PTW = 180°`. Hence  

`∠PTW = 90° − ∠QTU`. (2)  

By (1) and (2), `∠TUQ = ∠PTW`. Similarly, `∠QTU = ∠TWP`. Because `TUVW` is a square, `TU = WT`. It follows that the triangles `TQU` and `WPT` are congruent. Similarly, these triangles are also congruent to the triangles `VSW` and `URV`. Therefore all these four triangles have the same area. It follows that the area of the shaded region is one quarter of the area of the square `PQRS` less the area of the square `TUVW`.  

The square `PQRS` has perimeter 28 cm and hence it has side length 7 cm. The square `TUVW` has perimeter 20 cm and hence side length 5 cm. Therefore these squares have areas 49 cm<sup>2</sup> and 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.  

Hence the area of the shaded region is given by `1/4` (49 cm<sup>2</sup> − 25 cm<sup>2</sup>) = `1/4` (24 cm2) = 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/8-square-answer2.jpg){image align="right"}
__Method 2__

Let `O` be the centre of the square `TUVW`. It is left as an exercise to show that `O` is also the centre of the square `PQRS`.  

Consider the rotation of both squares through a quarter turn anticlockwise about the point `O`.  

The effect of this rotation is to move `P` to `Q`, `Q` to `R`, `R` to `S` and `S` to `P`. It also moves `T` to `U`, `U` to `V`, `V` to `W` and `W` to `T`.  

It follows that this rotation moves the triangle `PTW` to the position of the triangle `QUT`, `QUT` to `RVU`, `RVU` to `SWV` and `SWV` to `PTW`. It follows that these four triangles all have the same area.  

It then follows, as in Method 1, that the area of each of these triangles is a quarter of the difference of the areas of the two squares. Hence the area of the shaded triangle is 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.

__Method 1__  

We see that 5 = 32 − 22, 7 = 42 − 32, 8 = 32 − 12 and 9 = 52 − 42.  

Therefore the first four integers given as options can be expressed as the difference of two squares. In the context of the IMC it is safe to deduce that the remaining option, 10, cannot be expressed as the difference between two squares.  

__Method 2__  

The first six squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36. Once we get beyond 25 the difference between consecutive squares is greater than 10. Hence if 10 could be expressed as the difference of squares, the two squares in question would have both to be at most 25. However, it is straightforward to check that there does not exist a pair of numbers taken from the list 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 whose difference is 10.  

Therefore we deduce that 10 cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares.

Let the area of the hexagon be a cm<sup>2</sup>.  

In the figure on the right we have added two more of the diagonals of the hexagon, and a line joining the midpoints of two opposite edges.  

The lines in the figure divide the hexagon into 12 congruent triangles. The shaded region is covered by 5 of these triangles. Hence the shaded area makes up five-twelfths of the total area of the hexagon.  

The area of the shaded region is 20 cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, `(5/12)a = 20`.  

It follows that `a = 12/5 × 20 = 48`.  

Hence, the area of the hexagon is 48 cm<sup>2</sup>.

From the figure in the question we see that the rhombus and the smaller hexagon have the same side lengths. We also see that the side length of the larger hexagon is equal to the sum of the side lengths of the rhombus and the smaller hexagon. Therefore the ratio of the side length of the smaller hexagon to that of the larger hexagon is 1 : 2.

We let the vertices of the triangle be `X`, `Y`, `Z` and the angles be `x°`, `y°`, `z°`, as shown in the figure.  

Because the circle with centre `X` has radius 1, it has area `π1^2`, that is, `π`. Of this area, the fraction that is not shaded is `x/360`. Hence the fraction that is shaded is `1 − x/360`. Hence the area that is shaded is `(1 − x/360)π`. Similarly the areas of the other two circles that are shaded are `(1 − y/360)π` and `(1 − z/360)π`.  

It follows that the total area that is shaded is given by  

`(1 − x/360)π + (1 − y/360)π + (1 − z/360)π = (3 − (x + y + z)/360)π`.  

Now, because `x°`, `y°` and `z°` are the three angles of a triangle, `x + y + z = 180`. Hence  

`(3 − (x + y + z)/360)π = (3 − 180/360)π = (3 − 1/2)π = (5π)/2`.  

Hence the total shaded area is `(5π)/2`.  

[Note that this answer is the same whatever the lengths of the edges of the triangle provided that they are sufficiently large that the circles do not overlap.]

---

We use the notation `cba` to denote the number with hundreds digit `c`, tens digit `b` and units digit `a`. Thus `cba` denotes the number `100c + 10b + a`.  

The number obtained by reversing the digits of `cba` is `abc`. The increase that results when its digits are reversed is therefore  

`abc − cba = (100a + 10b + c) − (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a − c)`.  

Hence, the condition that the three-digit number `cba` is increased by 99 when its digits are reversed is that `a − c = 1`, that is, `a = c + 1`.  

Now let `cba` be one such three-digit number. The hundreds digit `c` cannot be 0. Because `a ≤ 9`, and `a = c + 1`, we see that `c ≤ 8`. Therefore there are 8 choices for the hundreds digit `c`, namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The tens digit `b` can be any of the 10 digits. However, once `c` has been chosen, there is just l choice for `a`, since `a = c + 1`.  

Therefore the total number of choices for a three-digit number `cba` which is increased by 99 when its digits are reversed is `8 × 10 × 1 = 80`.

We let `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T` and `U` be the vertices as labelled in the figure on the right.  

Our strategy is to calculate all the angles in the hexagon `PQRSTU` other than the angle `x°`. We can then use the fact that the sum of the angles in a hexagon is 720° to work out the value of `x`.  

We let `ˆP`, `ˆQ`, `ˆR`, `ˆS`, `ˆT` and `ˆU` be the interior angles of the hexagon `PQRSTU` at the corresponding vertices.  

First, `ˆP = ˆQ = 90°` because they are angles of a square.  

Because it is an exterior angle of a regular pentagon, `ˆR = 72°`.  

Because the interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108°, we have `Sˆ = 360° − 108° = 252°`.  

Because the interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108° and the interior angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°, we have `ˆT = 360° − (108° + 60°) = 192°`.  

Finally, `ˆU = x°`.  

Since the sum of the angles in a hexagon is 720°, it follows that  

`ˆP + ˆQ + ˆR + ˆ S + ˆT+ ˆU = 720°`.  

Therefore, by the above facts about the angles in this equation,  

`90° + 90° + 72° + 252° + 192° + x° = 720°`.  

and hence  

`696 + x = 720`.  

It follows that `x = 24`.

Because the rectangle with side lengths `x + 4` and `y − 3` has the same area as the rectangle with side lengths `x` and `y`, it follows that  

`(x + 4)(y − 3) = xy` (1)  

Similarly, because the rectangle with side lengths `x + 8` and `y − 4` has the same area as the rectangle with side lengths `x` and `y`,  

`(x + 8)(y − 4) = xy` (2)  

By expanding the left hand sides of equations (1) and (2), we obtain  

`xy − 3x + 4y − 12 = xy` (3)  

and  

`xy − 4x + 8y − 32 = xy` (4)  

By subtracting `xy` from both sides of equations (3) and (4), it follows that  

`−3x + 4y = 12` (5)  

and  

`−4x + 8y = 32` (6)  

We now subtract twice equation (5) from equation (6). This gives  

`(−4x + 8y) − (−6x + 8y) = 32 − 24`  

That is, `2x = 8`, and hence  

`x = 4`.  

Substituting this value for `x` in equation (5) we deduce that  

`−12 + 4y = 12`.  

Hence  

`4y = 24 `

and it follows that  

`y = 6`.  

Therefore `x + y = 4 + 6 = 10`.

In this question we use the notation `...cba` for the positive integer which has units digit `a`, tens digit `b`, hundreds digit `c`, and so on.  

We first note that `72 = 8 × 9`. Hence, as 8 and 9 have no common factors (other than 1), the test for whether a number is divisible by 72 is that it should be divisible both by 8 and by 9.  

Next we consider the criteria for divisibility by 8 and by 9. These are as follows.  

• For the number `...cba` to be divisible by 8, the number `cba` made up of its last three digits has to be divisible by 8.  
• For the number `...cba` to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits has to be divisible by 9.  

It is easy to check that if each of the digits `a`, `b` and `c` is either 0 or 1, and `cba` is divisible by 8, then `cba = 000`.  

The sum of the digits of an integer each of whose digits is 0 or 1 is equal to the number of its digits that are 1s. So if the integer is to be divisible by 9, the number of its digits that are 1s has to be a multiple of 9. The fewer the number of digits, the smaller the number will be. The smallest positive multiple of 9 is, of course, 9 itself.  

So the integer we seek is the integer with the smallest number of digits which ends with three 0s and includes nine 1s. This the integer which consists of nine 1s followed by three 0s.  

Therefore the required integer is 111,111,111,000. This has 12 digits.

Whatever value `x` takes, `x` is not equal to `x + 6`. Therefore, the values of `x` for which there are just two different numbers in the list are those for which either `x^2 = x` or `x^2 = x + 6`.  

The equation `x^2 = x` may be rearranged as `x^2 − x = 0`.  

The left-hand side of this last equation may be factorized to give `x(x − 1) = 0`.  

From this we see that there are two values of `x` for which `x^2 = x`, namely 0 and 1.  

The equation `x^2 = x + 6` may be rearranged as `x^2 − x − 6 = 0`.  

The left-hand side of this last equation may be factorized to give `(x + 2)(x − 3) = 0`.  

From this we see that there are two values of `x` for which `x^2 = x + 6`, namely −2 and 3.  

Therefore there are altogether 4 different values for `x` for which there are just two different numbers in the list, namely, −2, 0, 1 and 3.

Let `d` be the length of the diagonals of the squares. Each diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are each of length 2. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem `d^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8`. Hence `d = sqrt(8) = 2√2`.  

We therefore see from the figure that the width of the rectangle is `2 sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)`, that is, `3 sqrt(2)`. Also, the height of the rectangle is `2 sqrt(2) + 2 sqrt(2)`, that is, `4 sqrt(2)`.  

Hence the area of the rectangle is given by  

`3 sqrt(2) × 4 sqrt(2) = 3 × 4 × sqrt(2)^2 = 3 × 4 × 2 = 24`.

__Method 2__  

We divide the rectangle into 12 congruent smaller squares as shown in the figure.  

From the figure we see that the three 2×2 squares cover 12 triangles each of which is half of one of 12 smaller squares.  

It follows that the three larger squares cover half the area of the rectangle. Therefore the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the three 2 × 2 squares. Therefore the area of the rectangle is  

`2 × (3 × (2 × 2)) = 24`.

We give two methods. Both use the fact that the area of an equilateral triangle with side length `s` is `(√3)/4 (s^2)`.

__Method 1__  

We have labelled the vertices of the hexagon as shown in the figure. The points where the sides of the hexagon `QP`, `RS` and `TU` meet when extended have been labelled `X`, `Y` and `Z`, as shown.  

Because all the interior angles of the hexagon are 120° and the angles at a point have sum 180°, we have `∠RQY = ∠QRY =` 60°. Because the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, it follows that `∠RYQ =` 60°. Therefore the triangle `QYR` is equilateral, and hence `YR = YQ = QR = 1`.  

Similarly, the triangle `TSZ` is equilateral and `SZ = ZT = ST = 2`.  

Similarly, the triangle `XPU` is equilateral. We work out the length of its sides as follows.  

We see that `YZ` has length 1 + 8 + 2, that is, 11. Also, because `∠RYQ = ∠TZS =` 60°, the triangle `XYZ` is equilateral. Therefore `XY = XZ = YZ =` 11. It follows that `PX =` 6. Hence `XU` and `PU` also have length 6.  

The area of the hexagon `PQRSTU` is equal to the area of the equilateral triangle `XYZ`, less the areas of the equilateral triangles `QYR`, `TSZ` and `XPU`. Therefore, using the formula `(√3)/4 (s^2)` for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length `s`, we deduce that the area of the hexagon is given by  

`(√3)/4 (11^2) − (√3)/4 (1^2) − (√3)/4 (2^2) − (√3)/4 (6^2)`  
`= (√3)/4 (11^2 − 1^2 − 2^2 − 6^2)`  
`=(√3)/4 (121 − 1 − 4 − 36)`  
`= (√3)/4 (80) = 20√3`.

__Method 2__

We divide the hexagon into equilateral triangles all of which have side length 1, as shown in the figure. By counting we see that there are 80 of these triangles.  

It follows from the formula `(√3)/4 (s^2)` for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length `s` that each of 80 equilateral triangles with side length 1 has has area `(√3)/4`.  

Therefore the total area of these triangles is `80 × (√3)/4 = 20√3`.

A list of 5 positive integers has mean 5, mode 5, median 5 and range 5.  

How many such lists of 5 positive integers are there?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

We suppose that the positive integers in the list are `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `e`, where `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e`.  

Because the median is 5, we have `c = 5`.  

Because the mode is 5, there must be at least two 5s in the list. Therefore, either `b = 5` or `d = 5`.  

Because the range is 5, we have `e = a + 5`. Hence the list is either `a`, 5, 5, d, `a + 5` or `a`, `b`, 5, 5, `a + 5`.  

Because the 5 numbers in the list have mean 5, their sum is `5 × 5`, that is, 25. Therefore in the first case `a + 5 + 5 + d + (a + 5) = 25` and hence `d = 10 − 2a`, and in the second case, `a + b + 5 + 5 + (a + 5) = 25` and hence `b = 10 − 2a`.  

Hence the list is either `a`, 5, 5, `10 − 2a`, `a + 5` or `a`, `10 − 2a`, 5, 5, `a + 5`.  

In the first case we have `5 ≤ 10 − 2a ≤ a + 5`, and hence `2a ≤ 5` and `5 ≤ 3a`. It follows that, as a is an integer, 2 is the only possible value for `a`.  

In the second case we have `a ≤ 10 − 2a ≤ 5`, and hence `3a ≤ 10` and `5 ≤ 2a`. It follows that, as a is an integer, 3 is the only possible value for `a`.  

It follows that the only lists that satisfy the given conditions are 2, 5, 5, 6, 7 and 3, 4, 5, 5, 8.  

Therefore there are just 2 lists that meet the given conditions.

We label the vertices of the two triangles as shown in the figure. We let `V` and `W`, respectively, be the points where the perpendiculars from `T` and `U` to `QR` meet `QR`.  

Because each point of the triangle `STU` is at the distance `sqrt(3)` from the nearest point of the triangle `PQR`, we have `TV = UW = sqrt(3)`.  

Similarly, the distance from `T` to `PQ` is `sqrt(3)`. Therefore `T` is equidistant from the sides `QR` and `QP` of the triangle `PQR`.  

Hence the line `QT` bisects the angle of the equilateral triangle at `Q`. Therefore `∠VQT = 30°`.  

It follows that the triangle `TQV` has one right angle and its other angles are `30°` and `60°`. Therefore `QT = 2TV = 2 sqrt(3)`.  

By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to this triangle, `QT^2 = QV^2 + TV^2`.  

It follows that `QV^2 = QT^2 − TV^2 = (2 sqrt(3))^2 − sqrt(3)^2 = 12 − 3 = 9`.  

Hence `QV = 3`. Similarly `WR = 3`.  

Because `TVWU` is a rectangle, `TU = VW`. Hence, we have  

`QR = QV + VW + WR = 3 + TU + 3 = TU + 6`.  

It follows that the difference between the lengths of the edges of the two triangles is 6.
