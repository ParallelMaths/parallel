__3.1__ A certain company offers "750 hours of free Internet use for new subscribers". On closer inspection it becomes clear that this time must be used during the new subscriber's first month of membership!

__4.1__ Ima Divvy used her calculator and multiplied a number by 20 instead of by 2. What could she now do to obtain the correct answer?

* [ ] Divide by 20

* [ ] Multiply by 10
* [ ] Multiply by 0.5
* [x] Multiply by 0.1

---

Ima's result is ten times bigger than it should be, and therefore dividing by 10 will correct her mistake. Multiplying by 0.1 is equivalent to dividing by 10.

30 ÷ 0.2 = 300 ÷ 2 = 150, or 30 ÷ 0.2 = 30 ÷ 1/5 = 30 × 5 = 150.

__6.1__ In Britain in 1996 we consumed on average 9.6kg of bananas per person per year (that is, around 60 bananas each). In some parts of Africa, the consumption of bananas is as high as 250kg of bananas per person per year. Roughly how many bananas is that?

* [x] 4 or 5 a day
* [ ] 1 or 2 a day
* [ ] 4 or 5 a week
* [ ] 1 or 2 a week
* [ ] 4 or 5 a month
{.col-3}

---

250 kg is approximately 25 times 9.6 kg. The consumption in Africa is therefore approximately 25 × 60, ie 1500, per person per year. 4 bananas per day are equivalent to 4 × 365, ie 1460, per year and the best answer is therefore 4 or 5 a day.

__8.1__ In the diagram `PQ = PR = RS`. What is the size of angle `x`?

* [ ] 54°
* [ ] 72°
* [ ] 90°
* [x] 108°
* [ ] 144°

---

Triangle `PQR` is isosceles and therefore `PQR` = `PRQ` = 72°.

Triangle `PSR` is also isosceles therefore `RPS` = `RSP` = 36° (using the external angle theorem or by calculating that `PRS` = 108°) and `x` = 180° - 36° - 36° = 108°.

__9.1__ It is evening, and Meg, who is 1m tall, casts a shadow of length 3m. If Meg stands on her brother's shoulders, which are 1.5m above the ground, how long a shadow will she and her brother cast?

* [ ] 3m
* [ ] 4.5m
* [ ] 5.5m
* [ ] 6.5m

The ratio of height to shadow length is 1:3. Their shadow will therefore be 3 × (1 + 1.5) m = 7.5m long.

## 10.

::: problem id=10_1 marks=4
__10.1__ In March 1998, a book called "The Shadow of the East" was returned to a library in Sussex. It had been borrowed on January 3rd 1924! The library charges a fine of 60p per week for overdue books. Approximately how big a fine should the person who returned the book have paid?

* [ ] £45
* [ ] £180
* [ ] £230
* [x] £2200

The fine should be approximately 74 × 52 × 60p ≈ 75 × £30 = £2250. Although in reality, the person who returned the book disappeared without paying a fine at all!

__12.1__ In a right angled triangle the two shorter sides have lengths 10cm and 5cm. Which of the following approximations is closest to the length of the hypotenuse?

* [x] 11cm
* [ ] 11.5cm
* [ ] 12cm
* [ ] 12.5cm
* [ ] 13cm
{.col-5}

---

Let the hypotenuse be of length `h` cm. Then `h^2 = 100 + 25 = 125`.  

Therefore `h = sqrt(125); 11^2 - 121` and `12^2 - 144`, therefore 11 < `h` < 12.  

`11.5^2 = (11 + 1/2)^2 = 11^2 + 2 × 11 × 1/2 + 1/4 = 132 1/4`, therefore 11 < `h` < 11.5.  

`11.25^2 = (11 + 1/4)^2 = 121 + 2 × 11 × 1/4 + 1/6`, therefore `11.25^2 > 126.5`, therefore 11 < `h` < 11.15.  

The length of the the hypotenuse is therefore closer to 11 cm than 11.5 cm.

__13.1__ The diagram shows a semicircle containing a circle which touches the circumference of the semicircle and goes through its centre. What fraction of the semicircle is shaded?

* [ ] `2/3`
* [x] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/π`
* [ ] `2/π`
* [ ] `3/π`

---

Let the radius of the circle be `r`. This implies that the radius of the semicircle is `2r`. The area of the semicircle is therefore `1/2 × π × (2r)^2 = 2πr^2` which is twice the area of the circle.

## 14.

::: problem id=14_1 marks=4
__14.1__ Which of the following statements is false?

* [ ] An octagon has twenty diagonals.
* [ ] A hexagon has nine diagonals.
* [ ] A hexagon has four more diagonals than a pentagon.
* [ ] A pentagon has the same number of diagonals as it has sides.
* [x] A quadrilateral has twice as many diagonals as it has sides.

---

The number of diagonals in an `n`-sided polygon is `1/2 n (n - 3)`. This can be used to show that the first four statements are all correct. A quadrilateral has half as many diagonals as sides, not twice as many.

__15.1__ A pencil `AB` lying on a table is given a half-turn about the end `B` (so that `A` moves to `A'`) and then a half-turn about `A'` (so that `B` moves to `B'`).  

The point `C` on the pencil is one third of the way from `A` to `B`.  

What is the ratio of the total distances moved by `A` and by `C`?

* [ ] 3:1
* [ ] 3:2
* [x] 1:1
* [ ] 2:3
* [ ] 1:3
{.col-5}

---

Let `AB` be of length `3r`. The distanced moved by `A` is then the circumference of a semicircle of radius `3r`, ie `3πr`. `C` moves along the circumference of a semicircle of radius `2r`, ie `2πr`, followed by the circumference of a semicircle of radius `r`, ie `πr`. The total distance moved by `C` is therefore also `3πr`.

* [ ] (ii) only
* [ ] (iii) only
* [ ] (i) and (iii)

All powers of 3 are odd and `3^10 = 3^5 × 3^5` which means that `3^10` is also square.

__17.1__ The three circles in the diagram have the same centre and have radii 3cm, 4cm and 5cm.  

What percentage of the area of the largest cirlce is shaded?

* [ ] 20%
* [ ] 25%
* [x] 28%
* [ ] 30%

---

The area of the largest circle = 25π cm<sup>2</sup>.  

The shaded area = (16π - 9π) cm<sup>2</sup> = 7π cm<sup>2</sup>.  

The percentage which is shaded = `7/25` × 100% = 28%.

* [ ] 4
* [x] 7
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] more information needed

---

Let the number of boys in Group I be `x`. The number of girls in Group I is therefore 40 - `x` and the number of girls in Group II is 33 - (40 - `x`) = `x` - 7.  

There are therefore 7 girls fewer in Group II than there are boys in Group I.

1 _wuggle_ = 6 _waggles_;

All are therefore greater than 3 _waggles_.

Two murders: `2x` hours;  
Six car thefts: `6(x/6)` = `x` hours;  
Four bank robberies: `4(x/2)` = `2x` hours.

__22.1__ In the _Soft Boulder Café_ each table has 3 legs, each chair has 4 legs and all the customers and the three members of staff have two legs each. There are four chairs at each table.

206 - the 6 legs of the staff = 200. On average, at each table, there are three table legs, 16 chair legs, and 6 customer legs, which gives a total of 25 legs per table. 200 ÷ 25 = 8, hence there are 8 tables and therefore 32 chairs.

__23.1__ In the star shown here the sum of the four numbers in any "line" is the same for each of the five "lines".  

The five missing numbers are 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  

Which number is represented by K?

---

The ten numbers in the star total 75. Each number appears in two "lines" and therefore the five "lines" total 150, which implies the sum of the numbers in each "line" is 30.  

This means that K + C = 24 and therefore K = 11 and C = 13, or vice versa.  

If K = 11, then U = 12; I = 10 and M = 11, which is impossible since K = 11.  

If K = 13, then U = 10; I = 12; M = 9 and C = 11, which is correct.

The fold is made along `BE`. `A` folds onto `A'`.  

`A'B = AB = sqrt(2)`, therefore `A'C - 1` (by Pythagorus).  

Triangle `A'BC` is therefore a right-angled isosceles triangle, therefore `BA'C = 45°`, therefore `EA'D - 45°`.  

Thus `ED = A'D = sqrt(2) - 1`.
