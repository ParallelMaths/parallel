__11.1__ The standard Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... begins with two 1s, and each later number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.  

Other Fibonacci-like sequences can be constructed by starting with any two numbers `a` and `b` (not necessarily 1 and 1) and using the same rule for creating the other numbers in the sequence.  

What is the first term of the Fibonacci-like sequence whose second term is 4 and whose fifth term is 22?

The two angles marked `y` are equal because they are in an isosceles triangle. For the same reason, the angles `z` are equal. Since an exterior angle of a triangle is the sum of the two interior and opposite angles, it follows that `a = 2y` and `b = 2z`.  

Now, `a + b = 180` since they are the base angles of a parallelogram. So `2y + 2z = 180` giving `y + z = 90`. But, from the angle sum of a triangle `x + y + z = 180`; hence `x = 90`.

Let the distance to the bike shop be `d` miles. Then the time going is `1/3 d` hours and the time returning is `1/12 d` hours.  

The total travelling time is thus `1/3 d + 1/12 d = 5/12 d` hours and the total distance is `2d` miles giving the average speed as `(2d) + (5/12 d) = 2 × 12/5 = 24/5` miles per hour.

Let `x` and `y` be the distances shown.

But there are a number of similar triangles and from one pair `x/8 = y/1` ie `x = 8y`.

`(shaded area)/(total area) = (8y + x)/(9 (x + Y)) = (8y + 8y)/(9 × 9y) = 16/81`.

Imagine the liquid became solidified. Rotate the can until the face which contains `XY` is horizontal.  

Now take the horizontal cross-section half way up the can which meets the plane face of the 'liquid' in the line `AB`. Observing that `AB` bisects the radius `PQ`, rotate the upper section of the 'liquid' about `AB` through 180°.  

The new position is shaded darkly and fits into the bottom right quarter (with some space to spare).

The actual fraction might be shown to be `2/(3π)`, ie approximately 0.21.

By extending the short sides, one can construct another triangle.

The description does not say that the heptagon has to be convex, ie all of its interior angles need not be less than 180°.  

Since (2 × 7 - 4) × 90 = 900 the interior angles of all heptagons total 900°.  

The creation of a heptagon with all the given conditions is possible as the diagram shows.  

Notice that four of the interior angles are acute and the other three are reflex angles.

To satisfy the stated condition, the display will have the form 10:Mm:Ss. The values of both M and S have to be chosen from 2, 3, 4, 5.
