The smallest possible number of pairs of students with the same mark will occur when every possible mark from 0 to 100 awarded to at least one student. This accounts for 101 students and therefore the remaining 19 students must all be awarded the same mark as exactly one of their colleagues. The 120 students are made up of 19 pairs of students who are awarded the same mark and 82 students who are all awarded a different mark from everyone else.
