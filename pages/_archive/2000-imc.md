* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

---

Take the units digits of any two numbers and multiply them together. The units digit of the answer is also the units digit of the product of the original numbers. As 7 × 9 = 63, the units digit of 567 × 3489 must also be 3.

__2.__ An ice cream stall sells vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice creams.

The pie chart illustrates the sales of ice cream for last Saturday.  

The number of vanilla and the number of chocolate ice creams sold were the same.  

The stall sold 60 strawberry ice creams.  

How many chocolate ice creams were sold?

* [x] 90
* [ ] 99
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 120
* [ ] 135
{.col-5}

---

The angle occupied by the 'chocolate' sector is `1/2(360° - 90°) = 135°`. This is `1 1/2` times bigger than the 'strawberry' sector and hence the number of chocolate ice creams sold is `1 1/2 × 60 = 90`.

__5.1__ In a magic square, each row, each column and both main diagonals have the same total.  

In the partially completed magic square shown, what number should replace `x`?

* [ ] 15

---

The numbers along the leading diagonal total 58 and this is therefore the sum of each row and column. We can now calculate that the number to the left of the 10 must be 20, and the number below that is 7. Hence `x = 58 - (16 + 14 + 7) = 21`.

* [ ] 2

* [ ] 4
* [x] 5

`5^2 + 2 = 3^3`.  

This is in fact the only solution of this equation for which `x` and `y` are positive whole numbers. Another way of looking at this is to say that 26 is the only whole number which is 'sandwiched' between a perfect square and a perfect cube. This was first proved by the French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat, in the 17th century.

`A`, `B`, `C` are all equidistant from `D` and therefore lie on a circle whose centre is `D`. `BC` is a diameter of the circle and `BAC` is therefore the angle subtended by a diameter at a point on the circumference (the angle in a semicircle).

The number may be divided up into 3300 blocks of '12345'. The sum of the digits in each block is 15 and hence the sum of all 2000 digits is 400 × 15 = 6000.

buying two more parsnips and three fewer turnips does not change the total cost and hence two parsnips cost the same as three turnips.

Alternatively, he could have bought twelve turnips instead of the eight parsnips and, together with four turnips, this makes sixteen turnips.

We need to write `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6` in the form `a × 10^n`, where `a` is not a multiple of `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6 = 3×4 × 2^10 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 2^6 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 10^6`.

The interior angle of a regular nine-sided polygon `= 180° - (360° ÷ 9) = 140°`.  

Consider the pentagon `ABCDE`: `EAB =  1/2(540° - 3 × 140°) = 60°`.

Let the number of ivy, nightshade and triffid plants be `i`, `n` and `t` respectively.  

Then: `2i + 9n + 12t = 120`  and  `i + n + t = 20`,  
where `i > 0`; `n > 0`; `t > 0`.  

Multiplying the second equation by 2 and subtracting the new equation from the first:  

`7n + 10t = 80`, and thus `7n = 10(8 - t)`.  

Therefore `n` is a multiple of 10, and since `1 < n < 20`, `n = 10`.  

Hence `8 - t = 7` and therefore `t = 1`.
