__21.1__ A wire in the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 9 cm is placed on a flat piece of paper.  

A pencil is held in the hole at the centre of a disc of radius 1cm, and the disc is rolled all the way around the outisde of the wire, and then all the way around the inside of the wire.  

What shape is drawn by the pencil?

On the outside of the wire, the pencil describes an arc of a circle as the disc rolls around each of the corners of the triangle, but this does not happen when the disc moves around the inside of the wire.

__22.1__ One hundred and twenty students take an exam which is marked out of 100 (with no fractional marks). No three students are awarded the same mark. What is the smallest possible number of pairs of students who are awarded the same mark?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [x] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 60

The smallest possible number of pairs of students with the same mark will occur when every possible mark from 0 to 100 awarded to at least one student. This accounts for 101 students and therefore the remaining 19 students must all be awarded the same mark as exactly one of their colleagues. The 120 students are made up of 19 pairs of students who are awarded the same mark and 82 students who are all awarded a different mark from everyone else.
