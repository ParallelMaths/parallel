__7.1__ Given that `x` and `y` are positive whole numbers and `x^2 + 2 = y^3`, which of the following is a possible value of `x`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---

`5^2 + 2 = 3^3`.  

This is in fact the only solution of this equation for which `x` and `y` are positive whole numbers. Another way of looking at this is to say that 26 is the only whole number which is 'sandwiched' between a perfect square and a perfect cube. This was first proved by the French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat, in the 17th century.

---

`A`, `B`, `C` are all equidistant from `D` and therefore lie on a circle whose centre is `D`. `BC` is a diameter of the circle and `BAC` is therefore the angle subtended by a diameter at a point on the circumference (the angle in a semicircle).

__9.1__ Leap years normally occur every four years. However, years at the turn of a century are leap years only if they are multiples of 400. Therefore the year 2000 was a leap year, but the year 1900 was not a leap year. How many leap years will there be between 2001 and 3002?

* [ ] 240

* [ ] 248

The numbers of multiples of 4 between 2001 and 3001 is 250. However the following years will not be leap years: 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900, 3000. This leaves 242 leap years.

__16.1__ The pattern 123451234512345... is continued to form a 2000-digit number. What is the sum of all 2000 digits?

* [ ] 7500

* [ ] 60,000
* [ ] 75,000
{.col-5}

---

The number may be divided up into 3300 blocks of '12345'. The sum of the digits in each block is 15 and hence the sum of all 2000 digits is 400 × 15 = 6000.  

Alternatively, the mean of the digits which make up the number is 3, and therefore the sum of the digits is 2000 × 3 = 6000.

__17.1__ Baldrick can afford to buy either 6 parsnips and 7 turnips or else 8 parsnips and 4 turnips. Both options leave him with no change whatsoever. If, however, he bought only his beloved turnips, how many could he afford?

* [ ] 11
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 13

* [ ] 25
{.col-5}

---

buying two more parsnips and three fewer turnips does not change the total cost and hence two parsnips cost the same as three turnips. Instead of six parsnips, therefore, Baldrick could have bought nine turnips and, together with seven turnips, this makes a total of sixteen turnips. Alternatively, he could have bought twelve turnips instead of the eight parsnips and, together with four turnips, this makes sixteen turnips.

* [ ] None
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] more than 6
{.col-5}

---

We need to write `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6` in the form `a × 10^n`, where `a` is not a multiple of `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6 = 3×4 × 2^10 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 2^6 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 10^6`.  

Hence the number ends in six zeroes.

We need to express 1800 as the product of two factors, one of which (her age in months) is between twelve and thirteen times the other (her age in complete years). These are 150 and 12 respectively. Mary is 150 months old, ie she was twelve on her last birthday and she is now 12 years 6 months old.

The smallest possible number of pairs of students with the same mark will occur when every possible mark from 0 to 100 awarded to at least one student. This accounts for 101 students and therefore the remaining 19 students must all be awarded the same mark as exactly one of their colleagues. The 120 students are made up of 19 pairs of students who are awarded the same mark and 82 students who are all awarded a different mark from everyone else.

---

The interior angle of a regular nine-sided polygon `= 180° - (360° ÷ 9) = 140°`.  

Consider the pentagon `ABCDE`: `EAB =  1/2(540° - 3 × 140°) = 60°`.  

Similarly `FAI = 60°` and hence `FAE = 140° - (60° + 60°) = 20°`.

__24.1__ Jasmine spends exactly £120 on three types of plants: poisoned ivy, deadly nightshade and triffids. Poisoned ivy plants cost £2 each, deadly nightshade plants cost £9 each, and triffids cost £12 each. She buys twenty plants in total, including at leasst one of each type. How many triffids did she buy?

* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] more information needed
{.col-5}

---

Let the number of ivy, nightshade and triffid plants be `i`, `n` and `t` respectively.  

Then: `2i + 9n + 12t = 120`  and  `i + n + t = 20`,  
where `i > 0`; `n > 0`; `t > 0`.  

Multiplying the second equation by 2 and subtracting the new equation from the first:  

`7n + 10t = 80`, and thus `7n = 10(8 - t)`.  

Therefore `n` is a multiple of 10, and since `1 < n < 20`, `n = 10`.  

Hence `8 - t = 7` and therefore `t = 1`.
