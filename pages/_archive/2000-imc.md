__9.1__ Leap years normally occur every four years. However, years at the turn of a century are leap years only if they are multiples of 400. Therefore the year 2000 was a leap year, but the year 1900 was not a leap year. How many leap years will there be between 2001 and 3002?

* [ ] 240
* [x] 242
* [ ] 248
* [ ] 249
* [ ] 250
{.col-5}

---

The numbers of multiples of 4 between 2001 and 3001 is 250. However the following years will not be leap years: 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900, 3000. This leaves 242 leap years.

__10.1__ The average (mean) weight of five giant dates was 50g. Kate ate one and the average (mean) weight of the four remaining dates was 40g. What was the weight of the date that Kate ate?

* [ ] 10g
* [ ] 50g
* [ ] 60g
* [x] 90g
* [ ] more information is needed
{.col-5}

The total weight of the original five dates was 250g and the total weight of the four remaining dates was 160g.

__18.1__ The number `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6` is written out in full. How many zeroes are there at the end of the number?

* [ ] None
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] more than 6
{.col-5}

---

We need to write `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6` in the form `a × 10^n`, where `a` is not a multiple of `3^4 × 4^5 × 5^6 = 3×4 × 2^10 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 2^6 × 5^6 = 3^4 × 2^4 × 10^6`.  

Hence the number ends in six zeroes.

__19.1__ The product of Mary's age in years on her last birthday and her age now in complete months is 1800. How old was Mary on her last birthday?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [x] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
{.col-5}

---

We need to express 1800 as the product of two factors, one of which (her age in months) is between twelve and thirteen times the other (her age in complete years). These are 150 and 12 respectively. Mary is 150 months old, ie she was twelve on her last birthday and she is now 12 years 6 months old.

__20.1__ The population of five cities A, B, C, D, E in 1988 and 1998 are shown on these scales:

Which of the five cities showed the largest percentage increase in population from 1988 to 1998?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [x] C
* [ ] D
* [ ] E

The percentage increases are A: 25%; B: 40%; C: 42 `6/7`%; D: 30%; E: 33 `1/3`%.

__21.1__ A wire in the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 9 cm is placed on a flat piece of paper.  

A pencil is held in the hole at the centre of a disc of radius 1cm, and the disc is rolled all the way around the outisde of the wire, and then all the way around the inside of the wire.  

What shape is drawn by the pencil?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [x] E
{.col-5}

---

On the outside of the wire, the pencil describes an arc of a circle as the disc rolls around each of the corners of the triangle, but this does not happen when the disc moves around the inside of the wire.

__22.1__ One hundred and twenty students take an exam which is marked out of 100 (with no fractional marks). No three students are awarded the same mark. What is the smallest possible number of pairs of students who are awarded the same mark?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [x] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 60
{.col-5}

---

The smallest possible number of pairs of students with the same mark will occur when every possible mark from 0 to 100 awarded to at least one student. This accounts for 101 students and therefore the remaining 19 students must all be awarded the same mark as exactly one of their colleagues. The 120 students are made up of 19 pairs of students who are awarded the same mark and 82 students who are all awarded a different mark from everyone else.

__23.1__ `ABCDEFGHI` is a regular nine-sided polygon (called a 'nonagon' or 'enneagon'). What is the size of angle `FAE`?

* [ ] 10°
* [x] 20°
* [ ] 30°
* [ ] 40°
* [ ] 50°
{.col-5}

---

The interior angle of a regular nine-sided polygon `= 180° - (360° ÷ 9) = 140°`.  

Consider the pentagon `ABCDE`: `EAB =  1/2(540° - 3 × 140°) = 60°`.  

Similarly `FAI = 60°` and hence `FAE = 140° - (60° + 60°) = 20°`.
