*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1.	Are you as smart as an undergraduate?

Here is a mathematics question that appeared on the highbrow BBC quiz “University Challenge”.

@[youtube](htSeIWtA_1I?rel=0&end=26)

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1.__ A tap leaks 1 ml of water every second. How many 10 L buckets would it fill in a day?

I don’t want to pressure you, but after one student got the wrong answer on the TV show, the other student answered it in 20 seconds without pencil or paper.

<input type="text" solution="8"/>  

---

The number of seconds in a day is 60 × 60 × 24 = 86,400 seconds.  

This means the tap drips 86,400 ml, or 86.4 litres, or enough to fill 8 buckets of 10 litres each.  

The answer is 8 buckets.

## 2. An eclipse seen from space

I have been lucky enough to see five total solar eclipses: in America, the Faroes, Zambia, Libya and... Devon. But I have never seen one from space.

I spotted this image on a NASA website called [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/){target="_blank"}. There is a different Astronomy Picture of the Day each day, so visit regularly if you are interested in the universe.  

According to the NASA website:  

_“Here is what the Earth looks like during a solar eclipse. The shadow of the Moon can be seen darkening part of Earth. This shadow moved across the Earth at nearly 2,000 km/h. Only observers near the centre of the dark circle see a total solar eclipse - others see a partial eclipse where only part of the Sun appears blocked by the Moon. This spectacular picture of the 1999 August 11 solar eclipse was one of the last ever taken from the Mir space station. The two bright spots that appear on the upper left are thought to be Jupiter and Saturn. Mir was deorbited in a controlled re-entry in 2001.”_

::: problem id=3 marks=5

![](/resources/8-04-dripping-taps/3-angle-question.png){image align="right"}

__3.1.__  The diagram shows an equilateral triangle, drawn inside of a rectangle. Angles x and y have been labelled.   

What is the value of x + y?

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 45
* [x] 60
* [ ] 75
* [ ] 90

^^^ hint id=1
![](/resources/8-04-dripping-taps/3-angles-hint.png){image align="right"}
Notice that x and y are two of the internal angles of a pentagon.

We have highlighted that pentagon in this graphic.

Consider how this information can help you solve the problem.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2
What do the internal angles of pentagon add up to? The formula for calculating the sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is: (n - 2) × 180° where n is the number of sides of the polygon.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3
Remember that the triangle is equilateral. What is the value of the biggest angle in the pentagon, above angle x and below angle y?
^^^

^^^ hint id=4
You know that two of the angles in the pentagon are right angles.
^^^

This is tough question. Well done if you did it without hints. There are a couple
of ways to find the value of x + y degrees, but here is the neatest method.

The marked angles are two angles of the pentagon PRSTQ.

The angles Q and T are both 90°. The interior angles of the equilateral triangle
are all 60°. Hence the angle in the pentagon at R is 300°. The sum of the angles
in a pentagon is 540°.  

So x + y + 300 + 90 + 90 = 540.  

Therefore x + y = 60°.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ What is the mean of `2/3` and `4/9`?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `2/9`
* [ ] `7/9`
* [ ] `3/4`
* [x] `5/9`
 {.col-5}

---

The mean of two numbers, _a_ and _b_, is the average: `1/2`(_a_+_b_).

Hence the mean of `2/3` and `4/9` is:

## 5. Proving that four random dots create something wonderful

![](/resources/8-04-dripping-taps/5-random-dots.png){image align="right"}
Grab a pencil, paper and ruler.

*	Make 4 random dots (or ask someone else to make them for you).
*	Join up the dots to make a quadrilateral.
*	Put a mark at the midpoint of each line in this first quadrilateral.
*	Join up the four new points to make a new second quadrilateral.
* The second quadrilateral is a __parallelogram__.

You can test this by playing around with the interactive graphic on this page on the [Math Open Reference website](https://www.mathopenref.com/parallelograminscribed.html){target="_blank"}. You can drag the four orange dots wherever you want, and it automatically generates the first quadrilateral, the midpoints and the second internal quadrilateral, which is always a parallelogram.

But why is it true? How can you prove that the second quadrilateral is always a parallelogram?

On the same page as the interactive graphic, if you scroll down you will find a [short proof](https://www.mathopenref.com/parallelograminscribed.html){target="_blank"}. A mathematical proof is an extraordinary thing. A thing of beauty. Some are just a few lines, while others run for a hundred pages or more. Each proof is a step-by-step argument that shows why something is true or false with absolute 100% confidence. Once something is proven, then the proof remains solid for eternity.

For this reason, the mathematician G. H. Hardy once wrote: _“Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. "Immortality" may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean.”_

This particular proof is very short, but not simple to follow. Have a go at [understanding the proof](https://www.mathopenref.com/parallelograminscribed.html){target="_blank"} (remember to scroll down to find it), but don’t worry if it does not make complete sense.


## 6. Calculating Pi with Real Pies

A couple of weeks ago, we featured Matt Parker in a video talking about measuring π  using a pendulum. To end this Parallelogram, here is a another π-culiar video by Matt, in which he measures pi using pies. Watch and enjoy.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelogams.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Further Stuff

* Matt’s video is from a channel called Numberphile, which is full of fantastic mathematical stuff. Some videos are challenging, others are more straightforward, and a few are about the history or culture of mathematics. For example, [this video asks who is right? Brits who says MATHS or Americans who say MATH?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbZCECvoaTA?rel=0){target="_blank"}

* And this video, by Matt Parker, [shows you how mathematicians tie their shoelaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIgR89jv3Q){target="_blank"}. I don’t think it is part of the GCSE curriculum yet, but you will need to know about the maths of tying shoe laces for A Level, so it is worth learning the technique now.
