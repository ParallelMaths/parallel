After last week’s taster, it seems that Sumaze! is now a firm favourite with
lots of you. Huge thanks to Richard Lissaman, who created Sumaze! and who is
part of MEI (Mathematics in Education & Industry).

You will have access to 9 levels of the game, starting with some really trivial ones to allow you to understand the game, followed by some trickier levels. You score 1 point for level 1, 2 points for level 2, 3 points for level 3 and so on until level 9, for which you can score a mazimum of 9 points.

However, you will lose 2 points for every hint you use (available on levels 7, 8 & 9). And if you have to restart a level then you will lose 1 point each time, up to a maximum of 4 lost points. So, if you need one hint on level 9, then your maximum score goes from 9 down to 7. And if you succeed after restarting three times, then your score drops from 7 down to 4.

It is easier to understand Sumaze! by experiencing it, but in case it helps,
here are a few important rules and tips:

* Aim – to move your blue box to reach the “end of level” square.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number bigger than 1,000.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number that is a fraction.
* You sometimes need keys to open doors to reach the “end of level” square.
* Passing through an arrow means you cannot go back.
* To pass through a green square you must satisfy the square’s condition.
* Pink squares (and their operations) disappear when you move onto them.
* Lilac squares (and their operations) can be crossed over and over again.
* IMPORTANT – Sumaze won't run on a smartphone. If you are currently on a
  smartphone, then type this into your PC/Mac/tablet browser:

* You can stop and start Sumaze!, and the website will use cookies to remember
  your level and score so far, but it is better to finish all the levels once
  you have started.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=4.5
__2.1__ When you have finished Sumaze, you will receive a score and a code word.
Please enter your code word here, so that we can add your Sumaze score to your
verall Parallelogram total.

<input solution="sumaze" class="correct" placeholder="Sumaze Code Word"/>

Score: {{c.sumaze(c.answers.p_2)}} / 45 {.sumaze-score v-show="c.answers.p_2"}


_The maximum score in Sumaze is 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 9 = 45. We will divide your
Sumaze score by 10 and add it to your overall Parallelogram score. So ultimately
a perfect Sumaze score will add 45/10 = 4.5 to your Parallelogram total score._

## 6. OK Go

OK Go is an American rock band, famous for their quirky one-take music videos. This one shows an elaborate machine that employs all sorts of mechanics. Watch and enjoy … and look out for the answers to these two questions.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
__6.1__ In the last minute of the video, there is an interesting version of Newton’s cradle. Normally a series of suspended metal ball bearings swing to and fro, with the one on the left passing its momentum to the right, via the ones in the middle... and then vice versa. What is OK Go’s cradle made from?

* [ ] Water balloons
* [x] Sledge hammers
* [ ] Baseball bats
* [ ] Koala bears

__6.2__ Such machines often involve domino toppling, and there is domino toppling within the first minute of this video. However, in the second minute of the video there is domino toppling, but there are no dominos. What four objects are toppled?

* [x] Chairs
* [ ] Tables
* [ ] Wardrobes
* [ ] Fridges

Such machines have different names in the UK and the US, in honour of two eccentric inventors. Search on the internet to complete the names.
