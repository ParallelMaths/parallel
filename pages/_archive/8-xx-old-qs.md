## 4. Harmonic Pendulum

Take a look at this video of a collection of pendula (the plural of pendulum),
which behave in a beautiful and surprising way. It’s called a wave pendulum or
harmonic pendulum. It lasts three minutes, and it is worth watching right through
to the end to see the amazing effect.

Tom Rowett, who was in the video, has a huge and wonderful collection of odd objects,
and we will meet more of them in later Parallelograms. In this case, each pendulum
swings at a different rate, because it has a different length. In fact, there is
a formula that determines the relationship between the length of the pendulum and
the time it takes to swing from left to right and back to the left.

or   T = 2π √(L/g)

where
* __T__ is the time of a complete swing in seconds.
* __π__ is 3.14 (Wow! Always nice to see π.)
* __L__ is the length of the pendulum in meters.
* __g__ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²). Don’t worry about this –
it is a bit of physics that describes how an object falls due to the Earth’s gravity.

If you had a pendulum that was as tall as a human, say 2 metres, how long would
it take to swing? If __L__ = 2 meters, then:

__T__ = `2 × 3.14 × sqrt(2/9.8) = 6.28 × sqrt(0.204) = 6.28 × 0.4517`

__T__ = 2.837 seconds.

So a 2 metre pendulum takes 2.837, or nearly 3 seconds, to swing back and forth.

__4.1__ If one of the pendula in the video is 0.15 meters long, how long is the
period of the swing?

* [ ] 0.10 seconds
* [ ] 0.15 seconds
* [ ] 0.39 seconds
* [x] 0.78 seconds
* [ ] 1.00 second

::: problem id=4_2 marks=3
__4.2__ If you wanted a pendulum to have a swing time of 1 second (__T__ = 1 second),
how long should the pendulum be? At the moment the equation gives you the time
(__T__) depending on the length (__L__), so it might be useful to rearrange the
equation so that you have the length depend on the time.

* [ ] 0.18 metres
* [x] 0.248 metres
* [ ] 0.99 metres
* [ ] 1.16 metres
* [ ] 1.8 metres

We want to know L for a T of 1 second, so:

  `L= g(T÷(2π))^2`
  `L= 9.8 × (1 ÷ 6.28)^2`
  `L = 0.248 "meters"`
