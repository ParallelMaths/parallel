__4.1__ The coach of the Irish hockey team has a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour. If it travels this speed for two hours, roughly how many kilometres does it travel?

* [ ] 160
* [x] 200

One mile is approximately equal to 1.6 kilometres so 120 miles are approximately equal to 200 kilometres.

`(2000 + 3)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 × 2000 × 3 + 3^2 = 4000000 + 12000 + 9 = 4012009`.

__6.1__ Think of a number, double it, then add 3. Multiply your answer by 4 and from this take away 5. Now also take away the number you first thought of. No matter what your first number was, your answer will always be a multiple of:

* [ ] 5
* [x] 7
* [ ] 11

Let the number thought of be `x`. Then the final number is `4 (2x + 3) - 5 - x = 7x + 7 = 7(x + 1)`.

__7.1__ A number of years ago, a newspaper reported that Turkish football team Sarigol Municipality transferred four of its players in return for a fee of 225 sacks of cement, needed to repair their stadium. At the same rate of exchange, how many sacks of cement would the transfer fee for a full team of eleven players and one reserve?

__9.1__ It has been estimated that the mass of insects caught by spiders in a year in the UK is equal to the mass of the human population of the UK. Assuming this population is 60 million and the average mass of a human is 70kg, what is the mass, in tonnes, of insects caught by spiders per year in the UK?

60 million × 70 kg = 4200 million kg = 4.2 million tonnes, since 1 tonne = 1000 kg.

What is the size of `∠QOR`?

As `OQ` is the reflection of `OP` in `OM`, `∠QOM = ∠POM`; similarly, `∠RON = ∠PON`.  

Hence reflex `∠QOR = 2 × ∠MON = 260°`.  

Therefore `∠QOR = 360° - 260° = 100°`.

---

As each interior angle of the polygon is a whole number of degrees, the same must apply to each exterior angle. the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is 360° and so the greatest number of sides will be that of a 360-sided polygon in which each interior angle is 179°, thus making each exterior angle 1°.

Minnie's average speed this year is `5/4` of last year's value. Hence her time this year will be `4/5`, ie 80% of last yer's time.

The shaded area may be divided into a 2 × 1 rectangle plus a semicircle and two quarter circles, all of radius 1.  

Hence the total area is that of the rectangle plus that of a circle of radius 1, ie 2 + π.

__18.1__ When dates are written using eight digits, eg 06 02 2020, the 20th February 2002 is a palindromic date, since 20 02 2002 has the ame digits int he same order when read in reverse.

* [x] `1/2b (a + c)`
* [ ] `1/2a (b + c)`
* [ ] `1/2b (c - a)`
* [ ] `1/2c (a + b)`

---

The area of the pentagon is that of a rectangle of length `b` and breadth `a` plus that of a triangle of base `b` and height `(c - a)`, ie `ab + 1/2 b (c - a) = 1/2 b (2a + c - a) = 1/2 b (a + c)`.  

The area may also be considered to be the sum of the areas of two trapezia which have parallel sides `a` and `c` and whose heights have total length `b`.

__20.1__ Suppose that `e`, `i`, `n` and `t` represent different positive whole numbers, `n + i + n + e = 9`, `t + e + n = 10` and `i = 1`.  

What is `t`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---

We are given that `2n + e = 8 `and `t + e + n = 10`. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives `t - n = 2`.  As `n` cannot equal 1, the minimum value of `t` is 4 but this gives `n = 2`, `e = 4` which is impossible. If `t = 5` then `n = 3` and `e = 2`, which is allowed. If `t > 5` then `n > 3` and `e` is not a positive whole number, so 5 is the only possible value of `t`.

The figure shows the top left-hand corner of the complete diagram and we see by symmetry that the perpendicular from the corner to the short side of the rectangle has length `1/2`.  

Thus the diagonal of the square may be divided into three sections of length `1/2`, `x` and `1/2` respectively.

Thus length of this diagonal `= sqrt(10^2 = 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10 sqrt(2)`, so `x = 10 sqrt(2) - 1`.

__25.1__ The width:height ratio of television screens is changing form the traditional 4:3 to the widescreen 16:9. If a traditional screen and a widescreen have the same area, then what is the ratio widescreen width:traditional width?  

Assume that television screens are rectangles.

* [ ] `3 : 2`
* [ ] `3 : sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `4 : 3`
* [ ] `none of these`
{.col-5}

---

Let the widescreen width and traditional width be `w` and `W` respectively. Then the respective heights are `(9w)/16` and `3(W)/4`. As the areas are equal:  

`w × (9w)/16 = W × (3W)/4`, ie `w^2 = 4/3 W^2`. Hence `w`:`W = 2 : sqrt(3)``
