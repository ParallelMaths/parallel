The diagram shows that it is possible to fit five T shapes in the square. In order to fit six T shapes into the square, exactly one of the 25 squares would be left uncovered, hence at least three corner squares must be covered.  

We now label a corner square H or V if it covered by a T shape which has the top part of the T horizontal or vertical respectively. If all four corner squares are covered then there must be at least two cases of an H corner with an adjacent V corner.  

Each such combination produces a non-corner square which cannot be covered, eg the second square from the right on the diagram. If only three corner squares are covered, there must again be at least one H corner with an adjacent V corner and therefore a non-corner square uncovered, which means that it is impossible to fit six T shapes into the square.

As `OQ` is the reflection of `OP` in `OM`, `∠QOM = ∠POM`; similarly, `∠RON = ∠PON`.  

Hence reflex `∠QOR = 2 × ∠MON = 260°`.  

Therefore `∠QOR = 360° - 260° = 100°`.

As each interior angle of the polygon is a whole number of degrees, the same must apply to each exterior angle. the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is 360° and so the greatest number of sides will be that of a 360-sided polygon in which each interior angle is 179°, thus making each exterior angle 1°.

The area of the pentagon is that of a rectangle of length `b` and breadth `a` plus that of a triangle of base `b` and height `(c - a)`, ie `ab + 1/2 b (c - a) = 1/2 b (2a + c - a) = 1/2 b (a + c)`.

---

We are given that `2n + e = 8 `and `t + e + n = 10`. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives `t - n = 2`.  As `n` cannot equal 1, the minimum value of `t` is 4 but this gives `n = 2`, `e = 4` which is impossible. If `t = 5` then `n = 3` and `e = 2`, which is allowed. If `t > 5` then `n > 3` and `e` is not a positive whole number, so 5 is the only possible value of `t`.

Let radius of R's track be r and let the radius of the first semicircle of P's track be p; then the radius of the second semicircle of this track is r - p. The total length of P's track is πp + π(r - p) = πr, the same as the length of R's track. By a similar argument, the length of Q's track is also πr, so all three runners finish at the same time.

Each side of the dodecagon subtends an angle of 30° at the centre of the circumcirle of the figure (the circle which passes through all 12 of its vertices). Thus `∠AOB - 150°` and, as the angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is twice the angle subtended by that arc at a point of the circumference, `∠APB = 75°`.

It takes `ab` man-hours to the paint `c` square metres of the bridge and hence `ab/c` man-hours to paint 1 square metre. So `d` men will take `ab/cd` hours to paint 1 square metre and `abe/cd` hours to paint `e` square metres.

The figure shows the top left-hand corner of the complete diagram and we see by symmetry that the perpendicular from the corner to the short side of the rectangle has length `1/2`.  

Thus the diagonal of the square may be divided into three sections of length `1/2`, `x` and `1/2` respectively.

Thus length of this diagonal `= sqrt(10^2 = 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10 sqrt(2)`, so `x = 10 sqrt(2) - 1`.
