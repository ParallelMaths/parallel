# Year 7: Summer Problems #6

__Noun__: Parallelogram

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the final of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.



## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
Which of the following has the smallest value?

* [ ] `1/2 - 1/3`
* [ ] `1/3 - 1/4`
* [ ] `1/4 - 1/5`
* [ ] `1/5 - 1/6`
* [x] `1/6 - 1/7`
{.col-5}

---

The values of the five expressions are `1/6`, `1/12`, `1/20`, `1/30`, `1/42` respectively.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
An active sphagnum bog deposits a depth of about 1 metre of peat per 1000 years. Roughly
how many millimetres is that per day?

* [ ] 0.0003
* [x] 0.003
* [ ] 0.03
* [ ] 0.3
* [ ] 3
{.col-5}

---

A rate of 1 metre per 1000 years is equivalent to 1 mm per year, that is just under three thousandths of 1 mm per day.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
What is the value of ❤ if each row and each column has the total given?

![](/resources/2018summer-7-6/7-hearts-question.gif){image align="center"}

* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] More information needed
{.col-5}

Consider the third column: 2♫ + ❤ = 13  [1]

Consider the second row: ♫ + 2❤ = 11  [2]

`2 × [2] − [1]`
=> 3❤ = 9, so ❤ = 3.

Although their values are not requested, it is now straightforward to show that ♫ = 5, ☀ = 4.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
The list 2, 1; 3, 2; 2, 3; 1, 4; describes itself, since there are two 1s, three 2s, two 3s and one 4. There is exactly one other list of eight numbers containing only the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 that, in the same way, describes the numbers of 1s, 2s, 3s and 4s in that order.

What is the total number of 1s and 3s in this other list?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
{.col-5}

Let the other such list of numbers be `a`, 1; `b`, 2; `c`, 3; `d`, 4 and note that `a + b + c + d = 8` since there are 8 numbers in the list.


If `d = 4`, then exactly two of `a`, `b`, `c` equal 4, but this would make `a + b + c + d > 8`, so `d ≠ 4`.

Similar reasoning shows that `d ≠ 3`, so `d = 1` or `d = 2`.

If `d = 2`, then exactly one of `a`, `b`, `c` equals 4 and the remaining two both equal 1 since `a + b + c + d = 8`. So we have `a`, 1; `b`, 2; `c`, 3; 2, 4 and it is `b` which must equal 4 since we already have more than one 2. However, as `a` and `c` are now both equal to 1, we have 1, 1; 4, 2; 1, 3; 2, 4 and this is not correct.


So `d = 1` and we have and `a + b + c = 7` and `a`, `b`, `c ≠  4`. Clearly `a ≠ 1`, since that would give at least two 1s so `a = 2` or `a = 3`.

If `a = 2`, then we have 2, 1; `b`, 2; `c`, 3; 1, 4 with `b + c = 45` and `b`, `c ≠  4`. So `b = 2`, `c = 3` or vice versa. This gives either 2, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; 1, 4 (incorrect), or 2, 1; 3, 2; 2, 3; 1, 4 (the example given in the question).

Finally, if `a = 3`, then we have 3, 1; `b`, 2; `c`, 3; 1, 4 with `b + c = 4`. The possibilities are 3, 1; 1, 2; 3, 3; 1, 4 or 3, 1; 2, 2; 2, 3; 1, 4 or 3, 1; 3, 2; 1, 3; 1,
4 but only the first of these describes itself correctly.

So the total number of 1s and 3s is 6.

Cheerio,
