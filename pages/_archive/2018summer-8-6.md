# Summer Problems #6

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the final of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.

A shape consisting of a number of regular hexagons is made by continuing to the right the pattern shown in the diagram, with each extra hexagon sharing one side with the preceding one.

Each hexagon has a side length of 1 cm.

How many hexagons are required for the perimeter of the whole shape to have length 2010 cm?

* [ ] 335
* [ ] 402
* [x] 502
* [ ] 670
* [ ] 1005
{.col-5}

The first and last hexagons both contribute 5 cm to the perimeter of the pattern. Every other hexagon in the pattern contributes 4 cm to the perimeter.

The first and last thus contribute 10 cm, so we need another 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 hexagons. Therefore the total number of hexagons required is 502.

And that’s the end of the our sixth and final Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part.

Cheerio,

__1.2__ When a new guest arrives at the already full infinite hotel, how do they create a space for them?

* [ ] The new guest go to the room at the end  
* [x] All the other guests move over one room  
* [ ] The new guest goes into a negative number room  
* [ ] The new guest shares a room

__1.3__ What is infinity + 1?  

* [ ] It's not possible  
* [ ] Onefinity  
* [x] Still infinity  
* [ ] A light year

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ There are infinitely many positive integers and infinitely many negative integers.  

And of course, when we combine all integers (positive, negative, zero) we still have infinitely many.  

Which infinity is the largest?  

* [ ] The infinity of positive integers  
* [ ] The infinity of negative integers  
* [ ] The infinity of all integers  
* [x] They're all the same  

^^^ hint id=1_4_1 marks=1
Can you put all the integers in a single list?  

It might help to alternate between positive and negative integers (and don't forget about 0).

The first three collections of integers can all be put in a list, so they all have a countable infinity.  

For all integers, the list can be as simple as: 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ... and so on. Emily did say infinities are weird!
