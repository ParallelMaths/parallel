__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the final of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.

A shape consisting of a number of regular hexagons is made by continuing to the right the pattern shown in the diagram, with each extra hexagon sharing one side with the preceding one.

Each hexagon has a side length of 1 cm.

How many hexagons are required for the perimeter of the whole shape to have length 2010 cm?

* [ ] 335
* [ ] 402
* [x] 502
* [ ] 670
* [ ] 1005
{.col-5}

---

The first and last hexagons both contribute 5 cm to the perimeter of the pattern. Every other hexagon in the pattern contributes 4 cm to the perimeter.

The first and last thus contribute 10 cm, so we need another 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 hexagons. Therefore the total number of hexagons required is 502.
