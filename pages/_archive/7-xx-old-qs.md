## 6. A qustion to tst your writing skills

We have learnt that E is the most common letter in English, so how hard would it be to write a message that did not contain a single E? Your challenge is to write at least 50 words explaining what you did today, but you must NOT use any words that contain the letter E.

It will be tough, but the French novelist Georges Perec wrote an entire book (La Disparition) that was devoid of the letter E. It was then translated into English by Gilbert Adair, and once again none of the words in the book contained the letter E.
