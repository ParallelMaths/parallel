## 6. An easy puzzle

::: problem id=6 marks=3.5
__6.1__ I saw this in a newspaper – it was a puzzle for adults, fully grown humans, but
I think you will find it easy. All the digits from 1 to 9 are used in this grid,
but only once. Can you work out their positions in the grid so that each of the
six different sums work? Two of the numbers have been inserted in order to get
you started. Just identify the other seven numbers.

(NOTE: perform operations in the order they appear, e.g., `3 + 4 × 5 = 35` (not 23))

a = <input type="text" solution="6"/>  
b = <input type="text" solution="8"/>  
c = <input type="text" solution="7"/>  
d = <input type="text" solution="9"/>  
e = <input type="text" solution="3"/>  
f = <input type="text" solution="2"/>  
g = <input type="text" solution="4"/>

The easiest number to pin down is `d`, which has to be 9.

`5 ÷ 1 × 9 = 45`.

You may have followed a different route, but I then worked `c` and `g`. We know that
`9c + g` must equal 67, and `c` and `g` are single digits, so then `c = 7` and `g = 4`.

Now we know `c = 7`, then we also know that `a × b = 48`.

This means that a = 6 and b = 8 or a = 8 and b = 6.

We know that b + 1 is factor of 18 from the middle column, so `b = 8`.

We also know that `a × 5` is a factor of 90 from the 1st column, so `a = 6`.

And the rest is easy.

If you do manage to win, then just take a photo or screengrab, which includes the
date and time, and then email it to me at [prizes@parallel.org.uk](mailto:prizes@parallel.org.uk) – we will pick one winner
at random at midnight on Thursday (February 1st) and send them a copy of my book “The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets”.




## 6. Amazing James Randi and psychic surgery

A couple of weeks ago, you watched the Amazing James Randi perform some
escapology. Today, he is back again, this time performing some psychic surgery:
*	This video looks gruesome, so __don’t watch it if you are squeamish__.
*	Psychic surgery is fake, but some people believe it is real.
*	People waste time, money and hope visiting psychic surgeons.
*	See if you can work out how Randi performs his fake surgery.
*	__Really, don’t watch it if you are squeamish!__
