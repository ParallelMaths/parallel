## 6. An easy puzzle

::: problem id=6 marks=3.5
__6.1__ I saw this in a newspaper – it was a puzzle for adults, fully grown humans, but
I think you will find it easy. All the digits from 1 to 9 are used in this grid,
but only once. Can you work out their positions in the grid so that each of the
six different sums work? Two of the numbers have been inserted in order to get
you started. Just identify the other seven numbers.

(NOTE: perform operations in the order they appear, e.g., `3 + 4 × 5 = 35` (not 23))

a = <input type="text" solution="6"/>  
b = <input type="text" solution="8"/>  
c = <input type="text" solution="7"/>  
d = <input type="text" solution="9"/>  
e = <input type="text" solution="3"/>  
f = <input type="text" solution="2"/>  
g = <input type="text" solution="4"/>

---

The easiest number to pin down is `d`, which has to be 9.

`5 ÷ 1 × 9 = 45`.

You may have followed a different route, but I then worked `c` and `g`. We know that
`9c + g` must equal 67, and `c` and `g` are single digits, so then `c = 7` and `g = 4`.

Now we know `c = 7`, then we also know that `a × b = 48`.

This means that a = 6 and b = 8 or a = 8 and b = 6.

We know that b + 1 is factor of 18 from the middle column, so `b = 8`.

We also know that `a × 5` is a factor of 90 from the 1st column, so `a = 6`.

And the rest is easy.

## 6. Square it!

The great maths website NRICH has a tricky game called “Square It”. Play against
the computer in 1-player mode and see if you can win.

[Play the game](https://nrich.maths.org/2526){target="_blank"}

If you do manage to win, then just take a photo or screengrab, which includes the
date and time, and then email it to me at [prizes@parallel.org.uk](mailto:prizes@parallel.org.uk) – we will pick one winner
at random at midnight on Thursday (February 1st) and send them a copy of my book “The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets”.




## 6. Amazing James Randi and psychic surgery

A couple of weeks ago, you watched the Amazing James Randi perform some
escapology. Today, he is back again, this time performing some psychic surgery:
*	This video looks gruesome, so __don’t watch it if you are squeamish__.
*	Psychic surgery is fake, but some people believe it is real.
*	People waste time, money and hope visiting psychic surgeons.
*	See if you can work out how Randi performs his fake surgery.
*	__Really, don’t watch it if you are squeamish!__

## 6. A qustion to tst your writing skills

We have learnt that E is the most common letter in English, so how hard would it be to write a message that did not contain a single E? Your challenge is to write at least 50 words explaining what you did today, but you must NOT use any words that contain the letter E.

It will be tough, but the French novelist Georges Perec wrote an entire book (La Disparition) that was devoid of the letter E. It was then translated into English by Gilbert Adair, and once again none of the words in the book contained the letter E.

__Contact us with your 50-word account of your day and you could win a copy of my book, which talks about lots of fun maths in Simpsons/Futurama – which I will happily sign for you. (See, it is possible to write without using any E’s!)__

Email your 50-word account to [prizes@parallel.org.uk](mailto:prizes@parallel.org.uk) and we will pick our favourite.


## 6. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1__ The positive integers from 1 to 150 inclusive are placed in a 10 by 15
grid so that each cell contains exactly one integer. Then the multiples of 3 are
given a red mark, the multiples of 5 are given a blue mark, and the multiples of
7 are given a green mark. How many cells have more than 1 mark?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
* [x] 19

---
The squares that receive more than one mark are those which contain integers
which are divisible by at least two of the integers 3, 5 and 7. The integers 3
and 5 are coprime, that is, they have no common factor other than 1. Therefore
the integers that are divisible by 3 and 5 are precisely those that are
divisible by 3 × 5, that is, by 15. Every 15th integer is divisible by 15. Hence
the number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by
15 is (`150 ÷ 15`) which is 10.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 3 and 7 are precisely those that
are divisible by `3 × 7 = 21`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 21 is 7, because 21 divides into 150 only 7 (and a bit) times.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 5 and 7 are precisely those that are divisible by `5 × 7 = 35`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 35 is 4, because 35 divides into 150 only 4 (and a bit) times.

So it seems that we have `10 + 7 + 4` (or 21) numbers that will have multiple marks because they have multiple divisors.

However, you need to check for numbers that are divisible by 3, 5 and 7, because they would have been counted three times, not just once – when you look for numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, then 3 and 7, then 5 and 7. In fact, the only number less than 150 divisible by 3, 5 and 7 is 105, so you only need to remove 2 from your tally, i.e., the answer is `10 + 7 + 4 – 2 = 19`.

## 5. Sumaze! Part 1

Sumaze! is a terrific new game that tests your core maths skills.

You will have access to 9 levels of the game, starting with some really trivial
ones to allow you to understand the game, followed by some trickier levels. You
score 1 point for level 1, 2 points for level 2, 3 points for level 3 and so on
until 9 points for level 9.

However, you will lose 2 points for every hint you use (available on levels 8 & 9). And if you have to restart a
level then you will lose 1 point each time, up to a maximum of 4 lost points. So, if you need one hint on level 9,
then your maximum score goes from 9 down to 7. And if you succeed after restarting three times,
then your score drops from 7 down to 4.

It is easier to understand Sumaze! by experiencing it, but in case it helps here are a few important rules and tips:

* Aim – to move your blue box to reach the “end of level” square.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number bigger than 1,000.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number that is a fraction.
* You sometimes need keys to open doors to reach the “end of level” square.
* Passing through an arrow means you cannot go back.
* To pass through a green square you must satisfy the square’s condition.
* Pink squares (and their operations) disappear when you move onto them.
* Lilac squares (and their operations) can be crossed over and over again.
* IMPORTANT – Sumaze won't run on a smartphone. If you are currently on a smartphone,
  then type this into your PC/Mac/tablet browser: bit.ly/parallel_sumaze
* If you want to explore more Sumaze puzzles, then check out the Additional Stuff section.

You can stop and start Sumaze!, and the website will use cookies to remember your level and score so far,
but it is better to finish all the levels once you have started.

[Open Sumaze](https://integralmaths.org/games/parallel_sumaze_i/){.external target="_blank"}

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4.5
**5.1** When you have finished Sumaze, you will receive a score and a code word.
Please enter your code word here, so that we can add your Sumaze score to your
overall Parallelogram total.

<input solution="sumaze" class="correct" placeholder="Sumaze Code Word"/>

Score: {{c.sumaze(c.answers.p_3_0)}} / 45 {.sumaze-score v-show="c.answers.p_3_0"}

*The maximum score in Sumaze is 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 9 = 45. We will divide your
Sumaze score by 10 and add it to your overall Parallelogram score. So
ultimately a perfect Sumaze score will add 45/10 = 4.5 to your Parallelogram
total score.*
