# Year 7: Summer Problems #2

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the second of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.

In the diagram, the small squares are all the same size. What fraction of
the large square is shaded?

* [ ] `9/20`
* [ ] `9/16`
* [ ] `3/7`
* [ ] `3/5`
* [x] `1/2`

---

The area of the large square may be considered to consist of thirteen equal squares (nine of which are shaded) plus eight ‘half squares’ and four ‘quarter squares’ (all of which are unshaded).

So the total unshaded area is `(4 + 8 × 1/2 + 4 × 1/4)` squares = 9 squares.

Hence half of the large square is shaded.

If a straight line is 0.2 mm thick, how many metres long would the line need to be to cover an area of one square metre?

* [ ] 0.5
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 50
* [ ] 500
* [x] 5000
{.col-5}

---

The thickness of the line is 0.2 mm, that is 0.0002 m. So, in order to cover an area of one square metre, the length of the line would need to be `1/0.0002`m, that is 5000m.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
Just William's cousin, Sweet William, has a rectangular block of fudge measuring 2 inches
by 3 inches by 6 inches. He wants to cut the block up into cubes whose side lengths are
whole numbers of inches. What is the smallest number of cubes he can obtain?

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 8
* [x] 15
* [ ] 29
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---
The only possible cubes have edge size 1 or 2. It takes 8 of the former to replace one of the latter, so William needs to cut as many cubes of edge size 2 as possible, namely 3.

The number of one inch cubes, therefore, is 2 × 3 × 6 - 3 × 8, that is 12.  

So the smallest number of cubes is 3 + 12 = 15.

At halftime, Boarwarts Academy had scored all of the points so far in their annual match
against Range Hill School. In the second half, each side scored three points. At the end of
the match, Boarwarts Academy had scored 90% of the points. What fraction of the points
in the match was scored in the second half?

* [ ] `3/100`
* [ ] `3/50`
* [ ] `1/10`
* [ ] `9/50`
* [x] `1/5`
{.col-5}

---
Range Hill scored only three points in the match and these were scored in the
second half. They represent 10% of the total points scored. As Boarwarts
Academy also scored three points in the second half, the proportion of points
scored after halftime was 20%, that is `1/5`.

## 8.

The diagram shows a square with sides of length `y` divided into a square with sides of length `x` and four congruent rectangles.  

What is the length of the longer side of each rectangle?

* [ ] `(y - x)/2`
* [ ] `(y + 2x)/3`
* [ ] `y - x`
* [ ] `2y/x`
* [x] `(y + x)/2`

---
Let the length of the longer side of each rectangle be `l`. Then the length of
each shorter side is `l - x`. So `y = l + l - x` and hence `l = (y + x)/2`.

And that’s the end of the second Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
