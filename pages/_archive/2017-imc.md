Which of the following is _not_ the sum of two primes?

* [ ] 5

---

The sum of two odd numbers is even. Therefore, no odd number is the sum of two odd primes. The only even prime is 2. It follows that if any of the odd numbers 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 is the sum of two primes, it is the sum of an odd prime and 2.  

We see that 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 5 + 2, 9 = 7 + 2, 11 = 9 + 2 and 13 = 11 + 2.  

The numbers 3, 5, 7 and 11 are all primes, so each of 5, 7, 9 and 13 is the sum of two primes. However, 9 is not a prime and therefore 11 is not the sum of two primes.  

As we show above, the only odd prime numbers that are the sum of two primes are those of the form `p` + 2, where `p` is an odd prime. In this case the numbers `p`, `p` + 2 form what is called a prime pair, that is, they are consecutive odd numbers that are both prime. It is an unsolved problem as to whether there are infinitely many prime pairs.  

According to the _Goldbach Conjecture_ every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. This has not been proved but, at the time of writing, it has been verified for all even numbers up to `4 × 10^18`. Some partial results are known. For example, Chen’s Theorem (proved by Chen Jingrun in 1973) says that all but a finite number of even numbers can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a number which is either prime or the product of two primes.

The diagram shows two circles with the same centre.  

The radius of the outer circle is twice the radius of the inner circle.  

The region between the inner circle and the outer circle is divided into six equal segments as shown.  

What fraction of the area of the outer circle is shaded?

* [ ] `3/5`
* [x] `3/8`
* [ ] `3/9`
* [ ] `3/10`
* [ ] `3/11`
{.col-5}

We suppose that the radius of the inner circle is `r`. It follows that the radius of the outer circle is `2r`. Therefore the inner circle has area `πr^2` and the outer circle has area `π(2r)^2`, that is, `4πr^2`.  

Hence, the area of the region between the inner and outer circles is `4πr^2 − πr^2 = 3πr^2`. Half of this region is shaded. Therefore the shaded area is `3/2 πr^2`.  

It follows that the fraction of the area of the outer circle that is shaded is given by `(3/2 πr^2)/(4πr^2) = 3/8`.

Because the angles are in the ratio 3 : 4 : 5 : 6, and 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18, the largest angle makes up `6/18`, that is, `1/3` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral. Similarly, the smallest angle makes up `3/18`, that is, `1/6` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral.  

It follows that the difference between the largest and the smallest angle is `1/3 − 1/6`, that is, `1/6` of the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral.  

The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is `360°`. It follows that the difference between the largest angle and the smallest angle of the quadrilateral is  

`1/6 × 360° = 60°`.

Four different positive integers are to be chosen so that they have a mean of 2017.  

What is the smallest possible range of the chosen integers?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---
We recall that the _range_ of a set of numbers is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the set.  

The smallest range of a set of four different positive integers is 3. This occurs when the integers are consecutive, and only in this case. We first show that we cannot have four consecutive integers with a mean of 2017.  

Assume, to the contrary, that n is a positive integer such that the consecutive integers `n`, `n + 1`, `n + 2` and `n + 3` have 2017 as their mean.  

Then `1/4 (n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3)) = 2017`,  

and hence `n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) = 4 × 2017`.  

It follows that `4n + 6 = 4 × 2017`,  

and hence `4n = 4 × 2017 − 6`.  

Therefore `n = 2017 − 3/2`, contradicting our assumption that `n` is an integer. This contradiction shows that there do not exist four consecutive integers whose mean is 2017. So the smallest possible range is not 3.  

On the other hand, we see that the four integers 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 have mean 2017, because  

`2015 + 2016 + 2018 + 2019 = (2015 + 2019) + (2016 + 2018)`  
`= 2 × 2017 + 2 × 2017`  
`= 4 × 2017`.  

The range of these numbers is 2019 − 2015, that is, 4. We deduce that the smallest possible range is 4.

* [ ] 81

---
The place-value notation means that ‘`ab`’ `= 10a + b` and ‘`ba`’ `= 10b + a`. Therefore  

‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= (10a + b) − (10b + a)`  
`= (10a − a) + (b − 10b)`  
`= 9a − 9b`  
`= 9(a − b)`.  

The largest possible value of `9(a − b)` occurs when `a − b` has its largest possible value. Because `a` and `b` are different non-zero digits, the largest value of `a − b` is 8 when `a = 9` and `b = 1`. In this case ‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= 91 − 19 = 72`.  

Therefore the largest possible value of ‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= 72`.

We let the angles in the triangle that is formed by the rectangles be `p°`, `q°` and `r°`, as shown in the figure.  

The angles of a rectangle are 90°, as shown. The angles on the line at the points where the bottom rectangle meets the other two are each 180°, as shown.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore, from the angles at the points where the rectangles meet, we have the following three equations.  

`p + 90 + 90 + x = 360`,  
`q + 180 + 90 + 43 = 360`, and  
`r + 180 + 90 + 29 = 360`.  

It follows that  

`p = 180 − x`,  
`q = 47`, and  
`r = 61`.  

Therefore, because the angles in a triangle total 180°,  

`(180 − x) + 47 + 61 = 180`,  

from which it follows that  

`180 − x + 108 = 180`,  

and hence `x = 108`.

We suppose that the equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 has area `a`. Because the areas of similar figures are proportional to the squares of their side lengths, it follows that the equilateral triangles with side lengths 2, 3 and 4, have areas `4a`, `9a` and `16a`, respectively.  

It follows that the areas of the parts of these triangles that are shaded are `4a − a`, `9a − a` and `16a − a`, that is, `3a`, `8a` and `15a`, respectively.  

Therefore, the total shaded area is `3a + 8a + 15a = 26a`. Hence `n = 26`.

Eve’s age is the total of all their ages, less the ages of Alice, Bob, Clare and Dan. Therefore we can find Eve’s age by subtracting from the total of all five ages both the combined total of the ages of Alice and Bob, and the combined total of the ages of Clare and Dan.  

Therefore Eve’s age is 105 − 39 − 38 = 28.  

Since the combined age of Dan and Eve is 44, we deduce that Dan is 16. Since the combined age of Clare and Dan is 38, it follows that Clare is 22. Since the combined age of Bob and Clare is 40, Bob is 18. Finally, since the combined age of Alice and Bob is 39, Alice is 21.  

Hence the youngest is Dan.

The diagram shows a quadrilateral `PQRS` made from two similar right-angled triangles, `PQR` and `PRS`.  

The length `PQ` is 3, the length `QR` is 4 and `∠PRQ = ∠PSR`.  

What is the perimeter of `PQRS`?

* [x] 22
* [ ] 22 5/6
* [ ] 27
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 45 1/3

---

Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the right-angled triangle `PQR` gives `RP^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25`. Therefore `RP` has length 5.  

The corresponding sides `PQ` and `PR` of the similar triangles `PQR` and `PRS` have lengths 3 and 5.  

It follows that the ratio of the perimeter of `PQR` to that of `PRS` is 3 : 5.  

The perimeter of the triangle `PQR` is `PQ + QR + RP = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`. Let the perimeter of `PRS` be `p`. Then 12 : `p` = 3 : 5. Hence  

`12/p = 3/5`.  

Hence  

`p = 5/3 × 12 = 60/3 = 20`.  

The perimeter of `PQRS` is `PQ + QR + RS + SP`. This is equal to `((PQ + QR + RP)− RP) + ((RS + SP + RP) − RP)`. Thus the perimeter equals the sum of the perimeters of `PQR` and `PRS` less twice the length of `RP`. We deduce that the perimeter of `PQRS` is `12 + 20 − 2 × 5 = 32 − 10 = 22`.

We note first that `64 = 2^6` and `512 = 2^9`. Therefore `64^x = (2^6)^x = 2^(6x), and 512^5 = (2^9)^5 = 2^(9 × 5) = 2^45`.  

It follows that the equation `64^x = 512^5` is equivalent to the equation `2^(6x) = 2^45`. We deduce from this that `6x = 45`. Hence  

`x = 45/6 = 15/2 = 7.5`.

__Method 1__  

We let `∠QRS = x°`. Because `SQ = QR`, the triangle `SQR` is isosceles. Therefore `∠RSQ = ∠QRS = x°`.  

Because `∠SPQ = 2 × ∠RSQ`, we deduce that `∠SPQ = 2x°`. Since `PQ = SQ`, the triangle `SPQ` is isosceles. Therefore `∠PSQ = ∠SPQ = 2x°`.  

It follows that `∠RSP = 2x° + x° = 3x°`.  

We now apply the fact that the angles of a triangle have sum 180° to the triangle `PRS`. This gives `x + 2x + 3x = 180`. Hence `6x = 180`. Therefore `x = 30`. It follows that `∠QRS` is 30°.

Because `PQ = SQ = QR`, the point `S` lies on the circle with centre `Q` which goes through `P` and `R`. It follows that `∠RSP` is the angle in a semicircle and hence is 90°.  

We now apply the fact that the angles of a triangle have sum 180° to the triangle `PRS`. This gives `x + 2x + 90 = 180`. Hence `3x = 90`. Therefore `x = 30`. It follows that `∠QRS` is 30°.

We let the two positive integers be `m` and `n`, with `m ≥ n`.  

From the information in the question we deduce that `mn = 2(m + n)` and `mn = 6(m − n)`.  

It follows that `6(m − n) = 2(m + n)`.  

Hence `6m − 6n = 2m + 2n`.  

It follows that `4m = 8n`, and therefore `m = 2n`.  

Substituting `2n` for `m` in the equation `mn` = `2(m + n)`, gives `2n^2 = 6n`.  

Because `n ≠ 0`, we can divide both sides of this last equation by `2n` to deduce that `n = 3`.  

Therefore `m = 6`.  

Hence `m + n = 6 + 3 = 9`.  

Therefore the sum of the two integers is 9.

__Method 1__

We use the fact that the sum of the angles of a pentagon is 540°. Hence, each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108°. We also know that the interior angles of the rectangles are each 90°.  

We now consider the pentagon `TUVWX`, as shown in the figure. The interior angles of this polygon at `T` and `W` are each 90°. The interior angle at `U` is the interior angle of the regular polygon, namely 108°. The interior angle at `V` is the sum of an interior angle of the regular pentagon and a right angle, that is, 108° + 90°.  

Therefore `90 + 108 + (108 + 90) + 90 + x = 540`. Hence, `x + 486 = 540`. Therefore `x = 540 − 486 = 54`.

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/17-pentagon-answer2.jpg){image align="right"}
__Method 2__

We label the vertices of the pentagon and one of the rectangles as shown in the figure.  

Let `YZ` be a line through `S` that is parallel to `UV`. It follows that the alternate angles, `∠SXU` and `∠XSZ` are equal. Hence `∠XSZ = x°`.  

By the symmetry of the pentagon about the line through `S` perpendicular to `YZ`, we have `∠YST = ∠RSZ`. Let `∠YST = ∠RSZ = y°`.  

The angles on the line at the point `S` have sum 180°. Because it is the angle of a regular pentagon, `∠TSR = 108°`. Because it is the angle of a rectangle, `∠TSX = 90°`. Therefore `2y + 108 = 180`.

Because `PQRS` is a square, `SR = PQ` and `PS = PQ`. Because the ratio `PT` : `TQ` is 1 : 2, we deduce that `PT = 1/3 PQ`. Similarly, we have `SU = 1/3 SR = 1/3 PQ = PT`.  

The lines `PT` and `SU` are parts of opposite sides of the square `PQRS`. Therefore they are parallel. Because they are also of equal length, it follows that `PTUS` is a parallelogram. Therefore `TU = PS = PQ`.  

It follows that the perimeter of `PTUS` is `PT + TU + US + SP = 1/3 PQ + PQ + 1/3 PQ + PQ = 8/3 PQ`. Therefore `8/3 PQ = 40` cm. Hence `PQ = 3/8 × 40` cm `= 15` cm. Therefore `PT = 1/3 × 15` cm `= 5` cm.  

We also note that, because `∠SPT = ∠PSU = 90°`, we can deduce that `PTUS` is a rectangle.

The shaded area is made up of seven sectors of circles each of radius 2.  

The area of a circle with radius 2 is `π × 22 = 4π`.  

The area of a sector of a circle is directly proportional to the angle subtended by the sector at the centre of the circle. A full circle subtends an angle of 360° at its centre. Therefore, if the total of the angles subtended by the shaded sectors shown in the figure is `x × 360°`, the total shaded area is `x × 4π`.  

The internal angles of a polygon with `n` sides add up to `(n − 2) × 180°`. Therefore, the internal angles of a heptagon add up to `5 × 180°`.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore the total of the angles at the seven vertices of the heptagon is `7 × 360°`. Since the internal angles have total `5 × 180°`, the total of the external angles is `7 × 360° − 5 × 180° = 7 × 360° − 5/2 × 360° = 92 × 360°`.  

Therefore the total shaded area is `9/2 × 4π`, that is, `18π`.

Therefore, between them `b` Brachycephalus frogs and `c` common frogs have `6b + 10c` toes and `4b + 8c` fingers. Hence, from the information given in the question, we have `6b + 10c = 122`, and `4b + 8c = 92`.

Because `NM` is perpendicular to `OP`, the triangle `OMN` has a right angle at `M`. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem,  

`OM^2 + NM^2 = ON^2`.  

Since `M` is the midpoint of `OP` and the circle has radius 8, it follows that `OM = 4`. Also `ON = 8`. Therefore, by the above equation `NM^2 = 8^2 − 4^2 = 64 − 16 = 48`. It follows that `NM = sqrt(48)`.  

In the right-angled triangle `NMP`, we have `NM2 = 48` and `MP^2 = 4^2 = 16`. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to this triangle, `NP^2 = MN^2 + MP^2 = 48 + 16 = 64`, and therefore `NP = 8`.  

It follows that the perimeter of the triangle `PNM` is `MP + PN + NM = 4 + 8 + sqrt(48) = 12 + sqrt(48)`.  

Because `sqrt(48)` is close to 7, the perimeter is close to `12 + 7 = 19`.

Two brothers and three sisters form a single line for a photograph. The two boys refuse to stand next to each other.  

How many different line-ups are possible?

* [ ] 24
* [x] 36
* [ ] 60

We first count the number of ways in which two brothers and three sisters can stand in line without two brothers being next to each other, without regard to which particular brother and which particular sister is in any given position.  

Counting from the left, the first brother can be in the first, second or third position. (He cannot be in fourth position as then the second brother from the left would be next to him in fifth position.)  

If the first brother is in first position, the second brother can be in third, fourth or fifth position. If the first brother is in second position, the second brother can be in fourth or fifth position. If the first brother is in third position, the second brother can only be in fifth position.  

It follows that there are six ways to arrange where the brothers and the sisters are positioned.  

These are listed below using B to represent a brother and S to represent a sister.  

B, S, B, S, S  
B, S, S, B, S  
B, S, S, S, B  
S, B, S, B, S  
S, B, S, S, B  
S, S, B, S, B  

For any given two positions which the two brothers occupy, they can be put in these positions in 2 ways. If the brothers are B1 and B2, these are B1, B2 and B2, B1.  

For any given three positions which the three sisters occupy, they can be put in these positions in 6 ways. If the sisters are S1, S2 and S3, these are S1, S2, S3; S1, S3, S2; S2, S1, S3; S2, S3, S1; S3, S1, S2 and S3, S2, S1.  

Since the 6 choices of which positions the brothers occupy, the 2 choices of how the brothers are put in these positions, and the 6 choices of how the sisters are put in the remaining positions may be made independently, the total number of different line-ups is given by 6 × 2 × 6 = 72.

The `n` th term of a certain sequence is calculated by multiplying together all the numbers

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/24-formula-1.jpg){image align="center"}

where `k` takes all the integer values from 2 to `n + 1` inclusive. For example, the third term in the sequence is:

Let `n` be a positive integer. The `n` th term of the sequence is

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/24-formula-answer1.jpg){image align="center"}

This expression may be rewritten as

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/24-formula-answer2.jpg){image align="center"}

which is equivalent to

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/24-formula-answer3.jpg){image align="center"}

In the product above we may cancel all the terms other than the denominator of `3/2` and the numerator of `(n + 2)/(n + 1)`.  

In this way the above expression may be simplified to

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/24-formula-answer4.jpg){image align="center"}

For this to be an integer, we require that `(n + 2)/2` be a square and hence that `n + 2` is twice a square. Because `n + 2 > 2`, the least possible value of `n + 2` is `2 × 2^2`, that is, 8. Now `n + 2 = 8` for `n = 6`.  

Therefore 6 is the smallest value of `n` for which the `n` th term of the sequence is an integer.

The diagram shows a circle with radius 2 and a square with sides of length 2.  

The centre of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of a side of the square, at a distance x from the side, as shown.  

The shaded region — inside the square but outside the circle — has area 2.  

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] `π/3 + sqrt(3)/2 − 1`
* [ ] `π/3 + sqrt(3)/4 − 1`
* [ ] `π/3 + 1/2`
* [ ] `π/3 + 1`
* [ ] `π/3`

We let `O` be the centre of the circle, and the points `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `Q` and `T` be as shown in the figure.  

The area that is shaded is the area of the square less the area of the part of the square that is inside the circle. Therefore we begin by working out this latter area.  

The part of the square that is inside the circle is made up of the segment of the circle cut off by the chord `JM` and the rectangle `JKLM`. We let the areas of these regions be `AS` and `AR`, respectively.  

From the figure above we see that `AS` equals the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` at the centre `O` of the circle, less the area of the triangle `JOM`.  

In the triangle `JOM`, `JO` and `MO` have length 2, because they are radii of the circle, and `JM` has length 2, because it has the same length as the sides of the square. It follows that the triangle `JOM` is equilateral. Hence `∠JOM = 60°`. Because 60° is one-sixth of a complete revolution, the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` is one-sixth of the area of the circle of radius 2. Hence the area of this sector is `1/6 × π(2^2) = (2π)/3`.

We now work out the area of the equilateral triangle `JOM` which has side length 2.  

We note that `T` is the point on `JM` such that `OT` is perpendicular to `JM`. Hence the triangles `JOT` and `MOT` are congruent. Therefore `JT = TM`, and hence `JT` has length 1. By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `JTO`, We have `OT2 = JO2 − JT2 = 22 − 12 = 3`. Therefore `OT` has length `sqrt(3)`.  

Therefore the triangle `JOM` has a base of length 2 and height `sqrt(3)`. Hence the area of this triangle is `1/2 × 2 × sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)`.
