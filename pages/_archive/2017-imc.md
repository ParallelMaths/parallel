The diagram shows a circle with radius 2 and a square with sides of length 2.  

The centre of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of a side of the square, at a distance x from the side, as shown.  

The shaded region — inside the square but outside the circle — has area 2.  

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] `π/3 + sqrt(3)/2 − 1`
* [ ] `π/3 + sqrt(3)/4 − 1`
* [ ] `π/3 + 1/2`
* [ ] `π/3 + 1`
* [ ] `π/3`

We let `O` be the centre of the circle, and the points `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `Q` and `T` be as shown in the figure.  

The area that is shaded is the area of the square less the area of the part of the square that is inside the circle. Therefore we begin by working out this latter area.  

The part of the square that is inside the circle is made up of the segment of the circle cut off by the chord `JM` and the rectangle `JKLM`. We let the areas of these regions be `AS` and `AR`, respectively.  

From the figure above we see that `AS` equals the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` at the centre `O` of the circle, less the area of the triangle `JOM`.  

In the triangle `JOM`, `JO` and `MO` have length 2, because they are radii of the circle, and `JM` has length 2, because it has the same length as the sides of the square. It follows that the triangle `JOM` is equilateral. Hence `∠JOM = 60°`. Because 60° is one-sixth of a complete revolution, the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` is one-sixth of the area of the circle of radius 2. Hence the area of this sector is `1/6 × π(2^2) = (2π)/3`.

We now work out the area of the equilateral triangle `JOM` which has side length 2.  

We note that `T` is the point on `JM` such that `OT` is perpendicular to `JM`. Hence the triangles `JOT` and `MOT` are congruent. Therefore `JT = TM`, and hence `JT` has length 1. By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `JTO`, We have `OT2 = JO2 − JT2 = 22 − 12 = 3`. Therefore `OT` has length `sqrt(3)`.  

Therefore the triangle `JOM` has a base of length 2 and height `sqrt(3)`. Hence the area of this triangle is `1/2 × 2 × sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)`.
