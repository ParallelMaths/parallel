The number ‘`tu`’ is the two-digit number with units digit `u` and tens digit `t`. The digits `a` and `b` are distinct, and non-zero.  

What is the largest possible value of ‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’?

* [ ] 81
* [x] 72
* [ ] 63
* [ ] 54
* [ ] 45
{.col-5}

---
The place-value notation means that ‘`ab`’ `= 10a + b` and ‘`ba`’ `= 10b + a`. Therefore  

‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= (10a + b) − (10b + a)`  
`= (10a − a) + (b − 10b)`  
`= 9a − 9b`  
`= 9(a − b)`.  

The largest possible value of `9(a − b)` occurs when `a − b` has its largest possible value. Because `a` and `b` are different non-zero digits, the largest value of `a − b` is 8 when `a = 9` and `b = 1`. In this case ‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= 91 − 19 = 72`.  

Therefore the largest possible value of ‘`ab`’ − ‘`ba`’ `= 72`.

We let the angles in the triangle that is formed by the rectangles be `p°`, `q°` and `r°`, as shown in the figure.  

The angles of a rectangle are 90°, as shown. The angles on the line at the points where the bottom rectangle meets the other two are each 180°, as shown.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore, from the angles at the points where the rectangles meet, we have the following three equations.  

`p + 90 + 90 + x = 360`,  
`q + 180 + 90 + 43 = 360`, and  
`r + 180 + 90 + 29 = 360`.  

It follows that  

`p = 180 − x`,  
`q = 47`, and  
`r = 61`.  

Therefore, because the angles in a triangle total 180°,  

`(180 − x) + 47 + 61 = 180`,  

from which it follows that  

`180 − x + 108 = 180`,  

and hence `x = 108`.

We suppose that the equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 has area `a`. Because the areas of similar figures are proportional to the squares of their side lengths, it follows that the equilateral triangles with side lengths 2, 3 and 4, have areas `4a`, `9a` and `16a`, respectively.  

It follows that the areas of the parts of these triangles that are shaded are `4a − a`, `9a − a` and `16a − a`, that is, `3a`, `8a` and `15a`, respectively.  

Therefore, the total shaded area is `3a + 8a + 15a = 26a`. Hence `n = 26`.

__Method 1__  

We let `∠QRS = x°`. Because `SQ = QR`, the triangle `SQR` is isosceles. Therefore `∠RSQ = ∠QRS = x°`.  

Because `∠SPQ = 2 × ∠RSQ`, we deduce that `∠SPQ = 2x°`. Since `PQ = SQ`, the triangle `SPQ` is isosceles. Therefore `∠PSQ = ∠SPQ = 2x°`.  

It follows that `∠RSP = 2x° + x° = 3x°`.  

We now apply the fact that the angles of a triangle have sum 180° to the triangle `PRS`. This gives `x + 2x + 3x = 180`. Hence `6x = 180`. Therefore `x = 30`. It follows that `∠QRS` is 30°.  

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/15-triangle-answer2.jpg){image align="right"}
__Method 2__  

We let `∠QRS = x°`. Because `SQ = QR`, the triangle `SQR` is isosceles. Therefore `∠RSQ = ∠QRS = x°`. Because `∠SPQ = 2 × ∠RSQ`, we deduce that `∠SPQ = 2x°`.  

Because `PQ = SQ = QR`, the point `S` lies on the circle with centre `Q` which goes through `P` and `R`. It follows that `∠RSP` is the angle in a semicircle and hence is 90°.  

We now apply the fact that the angles of a triangle have sum 180° to the triangle `PRS`. This gives `x + 2x + 90 = 180`. Hence `3x = 90`. Therefore `x = 30`. It follows that `∠QRS` is 30°.

We let the two positive integers be `m` and `n`, with `m ≥ n`.  

From the information in the question we deduce that `mn = 2(m + n)` and `mn = 6(m − n)`.  

It follows that `6(m − n) = 2(m + n)`.  

Hence `6m − 6n = 2m + 2n`.  

It follows that `4m = 8n`, and therefore `m = 2n`.  

Substituting `2n` for `m` in the equation `mn` = `2(m + n)`, gives `2n^2 = 6n`.  

Because `n ≠ 0`, we can divide both sides of this last equation by `2n` to deduce that `n = 3`.  

Therefore `m = 6`.  

Hence `m + n = 6 + 3 = 9`.  

Therefore the sum of the two integers is 9.

---
The 30 litres of water removed from the tank is the difference between `5/6` ths and `4/5` ths of the capacity of the tank. Now  

`5/6 − 4/5 = (5 × 5 − 4 × 6)/(5 × 6) = (25 − 24)/30 = 1/30`.  

We therefore see that 30 litres amounts to `1/30` th of the capacity of the tank. It follows that when the tank is full the number of litres that it holds is `30 × 30 = 900`.

Because `PQRS` is a square, `SR = PQ` and `PS = PQ`. Because the ratio `PT` : `TQ` is 1 : 2, we deduce that `PT = 1/3 PQ`. Similarly, we have `SU = 1/3 SR = 1/3 PQ = PT`.  

The lines `PT` and `SU` are parts of opposite sides of the square `PQRS`. Therefore they are parallel. Because they are also of equal length, it follows that `PTUS` is a parallelogram. Therefore `TU = PS = PQ`.  

It follows that the perimeter of `PTUS` is `PT + TU + US + SP = 1/3 PQ + PQ + 1/3 PQ + PQ = 8/3 PQ`. Therefore `8/3 PQ = 40` cm. Hence `PQ = 3/8 × 40` cm `= 15` cm. Therefore `PT = 1/3 × 15` cm `= 5` cm.  

We also note that, because `∠SPT = ∠PSU = 90°`, we can deduce that `PTUS` is a rectangle.  

It follows that the area of PTUS is given by `PT × TU = 5` cm `× 15` cm `= 75` cm<sup>2</sup>.

The diagram shows seven circular arcs and a heptagon with equal sides but unequal angles.  

The sides of the heptagon have length 4.  

The centre of each arc is a vertex of the heptagon, and the ends of the arc are the midpoints of the two adjacent sides.

The shaded area is made up of seven sectors of circles each of radius 2.  

The area of a circle with radius 2 is `π × 22 = 4π`.  

The area of a sector of a circle is directly proportional to the angle subtended by the sector at the centre of the circle. A full circle subtends an angle of 360° at its centre. Therefore, if the total of the angles subtended by the shaded sectors shown in the figure is `x × 360°`, the total shaded area is `x × 4π`.  

The internal angles of a polygon with `n` sides add up to `(n − 2) × 180°`. Therefore, the internal angles of a heptagon add up to `5 × 180°`.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore the total of the angles at the seven vertices of the heptagon is `7 × 360°`. Since the internal angles have total `5 × 180°`, the total of the external angles is `7 × 360° − 5 × 180° = 7 × 360° − 5/2 × 360° = 92 × 360°`.  

Therefore the total shaded area is `9/2 × 4π`, that is, `18π`.

Let `b` be the number of Brachycephalus frogs in the bucket and let `c` be the number of common frogs in the bucket.  

A Brachycephalus frog has three toes on each foot and two fingers on each ‘hand’. Therefore, in total, it has 6 toes and 4 fingers. A common frog has, in total, 10 toes and 8 fingers.  

Therefore, between them `b` Brachycephalus frogs and `c` common frogs have `6b + 10c` toes and `4b + 8c` fingers. Hence, from the information given in the question, we have `6b + 10c = 122`, and `4b + 8c = 92`.  

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain `2b + 2c = 30`.  

Dividing the last equation by 2, we deduce that `b + c = 15`.  

Therefore, the total number of frogs in the bucket is 15.

In this way the above expression may be simplified to

For this to be an integer, we require that `(n + 2)/2` be a square and hence that `n + 2` is twice a square. Because `n + 2 > 2`, the least possible value of `n + 2` is `2 × 2^2`, that is, 8. Now `n + 2 = 8` for `n = 6`.  

Therefore 6 is the smallest value of `n` for which the `n` th term of the sequence is an integer.

We let `O` be the centre of the circle, and the points `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `Q` and `T` be as shown in the figure.  

The area that is shaded is the area of the square less the area of the part of the square that is inside the circle. Therefore we begin by working out this latter area.  

The part of the square that is inside the circle is made up of the segment of the circle cut off by the chord `JM` and the rectangle `JKLM`. We let the areas of these regions be `AS` and `AR`, respectively.  

From the figure above we see that `AS` equals the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` at the centre `O` of the circle, less the area of the triangle `JOM`.  

In the triangle `JOM`, `JO` and `MO` have length 2, because they are radii of the circle, and `JM` has length 2, because it has the same length as the sides of the square. It follows that the triangle `JOM` is equilateral. Hence `∠JOM = 60°`. Because 60° is one-sixth of a complete revolution, the area of the sector of the circle subtended by the arc `JM` is one-sixth of the area of the circle of radius 2. Hence the area of this sector is `1/6 × π(2^2) = (2π)/3`.  

![](/resources/xxxxxxxxxx/25-circle-answer-triangle.jpg){image align="right"}
We now work out the area of the equilateral triangle `JOM` which has side length 2.  

We note that `T` is the point on `JM` such that `OT` is perpendicular to `JM`. Hence the triangles `JOT` and `MOT` are congruent. Therefore `JT = TM`, and hence `JT` has length 1. By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `JTO`, We have `OT2 = JO2 − JT2 = 22 − 12 = 3`. Therefore `OT` has length `sqrt(3)`.  

Therefore the triangle `JOM` has a base of length 2 and height `sqrt(3)`. Hence the area of this triangle is `1/2 × 2 × sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)`.
