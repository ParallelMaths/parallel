Amrita is baking a cake today. She bakes a cake every fifth day.  

How many days will it be before she next bakes a cake on a Thursday?

Method 1:  
Amrita bakes a cake again after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 days and so on. Note that the IMC took place on a Thursday and so succeeding Thursdays come after 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days and so on. The first number in both of these lists is 35. So Amrita next bakes a cake on a Thursday after 35 days.  

Method 2:
Amrita bakes a cake after `n` days just when `n` is a multiple of 5. As the IMC took place on a Thursday, it is another Thursday in `n` days time just when n is a multiple of 7. So Amrita bakes a cake on a Thursday in `n` days time just when `n` is a multiple of both 5 and of 7. The lowest such positive integer `n` is the lowest common multiple of 5 and 7. The lowest common multiple of 5 and 7 is 5 × 7 = 35. So Amrita next bakes a cake on a Thursday after 35 days.

When travelling from London to Edinburgh by train, you pass a sign saying “Edinburgh 200 miles”. Then, 312 miles later, you pass another sign saying “Half way between London and Edinburgh”.  

How many miles is it by train from London to Edinburgh?

After travelling a further 3 `1/2` miles towards Edinburgh after passing the "Edinburgh 200 miles" sign, the train is (200 − 3 `1/2`) miles = 196 `1/2` miles from Edinburgh. As the train is now half way between London and Edinburgh, the distance from London to Edinburgh is (2 × 196 `1/2`) miles = 393 miles.

One third of the animals in Jacob’s flock are goats. Therefore two thirds of these animals are sheep. Therefore, the 12 more sheep than goats amount to one third of the flock. Since 12 animals make up one third of the flock, there are 3 × 12 = 36 animals in Jacob’s flock.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is `(n − 2) × 180°`. So the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon in the diagram is `(6 − 2) × 180° = 4 × 180° = 720°`.  

The sum of the angles at a point is `360°`. Therefore interior angle of the hexagon adjacent to the exterior angle of `75°` is `(360 − 75)°`, and the interior angle adjacent to the exterior angle of `x°` is `(360 − x)°`. Since the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon is `720°`, we have `24 + 27 + (360 − 75) + 26 + 23 + (360 − x) = 720`.  

We can rearrange the left hand side of this equation to obtain `(24 + 27 + 26 + 23) − 75 + (360 + 360) − x = 720`.  

It follows that `100 − 75 + 720 − x = 720`. Hence `25 − x = 0`. Therefore `x = 25`.

We have `a + b = 7`. Also, depending on whether `a > b` or `b > a`, the value of `a − b` is either +2 or −2. In either case, `(a − b)^2 = 4`, and so `(a + b)^2 − (a − b)^2 = 49 − 4 = 45`. Now:  

`(a + b)^2 − (a − b)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) − (a^2 − 2ab + b^2) = 4ab`.  

Hence `4ab = 45`. It follows that `a × b = 45/4 = 111/4`.  

In the above solution we were able to find the value of ab without first finding the values of `a` and `b`. An alternative method would be to first find `a` and `b` and then `ab`.

The diagram shows a heptagon with a line of three circles on each side. Each circle is to contain exactly one number. The numbers 8 to 14 are distributed as shown and the numbers 1 to 7 are to be distributed to the remaining circles. The total of the numbers in each of the lines of three circles is to be the same.  

What is this total?

* [ ] 18
* [x] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 21
* [ ] 22

---

Each of the integers from 1 to 7 occurs in exactly two of the seven lines of three circles. Each of the integers from 8 to 14 occurs in exactly one of these lines.  

Therefore, if we add up all the totals of the numbers in the seven lines, we are adding each of the integers from 1 to 7 twice, and each of the integers from 8 to 14 once. It follows that the sum of the seven line totals is  

`2 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14) = 2 × 28 + 77`  
`= 56 + 77`  
`= 133`.  

Since the total for each of the seven lines is the same, the total of the numbers in one line is `133 ÷ 7 = 19`.  

We have shown that, if the numbers can be placed so that the total of the numbers in each of the lines of three circles is the same, then this common total is 19.  

So, assuming, as we are entitled to, that one of the options is correct, we deduce that B is the correct option. For a complete solution, however, it is necessary to show that the numbers can be placed so that
the total of the numbers in each line is 19.

Tegwen has the same number of brothers as she has sisters. Each one of her brothers has 50% more sisters than brothers.  

How many children are in Tegwen’s family?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 11
* [x] 13
{.col-5}

---

Method 1:
Tegwen has equal numbers of brothers and sisters. Consider one of her brothers, say Dafydd. Dafydd has one more sister than Tegwen has, namely Tegwen. He has one fewer brother than Tegwen has, namely himself.  

It follows that Dafydd has 2 more sisters than he has brothers. He has 50% more sisters than brothers. Since 2 sisters is 50% of the number of his brothers, Dafydd has 4 brothers. Hence, he has 6 sisters. The children in the family are Dafydd’s sisters and brothers and Dafydd. So there are 6 + 4 + 1 = 11 children in the family.  

Method 2:
Suppose that Tegwen has `n` brothers. Since she has equal numbers of brothers and sisters, she also has `n` sisters.  

Consider one of Tegwen’s brothers, say Dafydd. All of Tegwen’s sisters are also Dafydd’s sisters, and Dafydd also has Tegwen as one of his sisters. So Dafydd has `n + 1` sisters. All of Tegwen’s brothers, other than Dafydd himself, are also Dafydd’s brothers. So Dafydd has `n − 1` brothers.  

Since Dafydd has 50% more sisters than brothers, it follows that  

`(n + 1)/(n − 1) = 150/100 = 3/2`  

and therefore  

`2(n + 1) = 3(n − 1)`,  

that is,  

`2n + 2 = 3n − 3`,  

from which it follows that  

`n = 5`.  

Therefore Tegwen has 5 brothers and 5 sisters. So, including Tegwen, there are 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 children in her family.

Let the vertices of the square be P, Q, R and S, as shown in the diagram. Let O be the centre of the circle. We also suppose that the length of the sides of the square is s cm. It follows that the area of the square is s2 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

We consider the triangles POQ and SOR. In these triangles ∠OPQ = ∠OSR = 90°, as they are both angles in the square; OQ = OR, as they are radii of the same circle; and PQ = SR, as they are sides of the same square.  

It follows that the triangles POQ and SOR are congruent, by the RHS congruence condition. [RHS stands for Right-angle, Hypotenuse, Side.] It follows that OP = OS = 1 2 s cm. Therefore, by applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the triangle SOR, we have  

`s^2 + (1/2 s)^2 = 1^2`,  

that is,  

`s^2 + 1/4 s^2 = 1`,  

and hence  

`5/4 s^2 = 1`,  

from which it follows that  

`s^2 = 4/5`.  

Therefore the area of the square is `4/5` cm<sup>2</sup>.

An integer `n` is divisible by 24 if, and only if, `n = 24 × m`, for some integer `m`. Since the prime factorization of `24` is `2^3 × 3^1`, it follows that `n` is divisible by `24` if, and only if `n = 2^3 × 3^1 × m`, for some integer `m`.  

Another way to put this is that an integer `n` is divisible by 24 if, and only if, in the prime factorization of `n`, the exponent of 2 is at least 3, and the exponent of 3 is at least 1.  

It follows from this that, of the given numbers, there is just one which is divisible by 24, namely `2^3 × 3^2 × 5^2 × 7^2`.

The shaded region in the diagram, bounded by two concentric circles, is called an _annulus_. The circles have radii 2cm and 14cm.  

The dashed circle divides the area of this annulus into two equal areas.  

What is its radius?

* [ ] 9cm
* [x] 10cm
* [ ] 11cm
* [ ] 12cm
* [ ] 13cm

---
In answering this question we use the fact that the area of a circle with radius `r` is `πr2`.  

Let the radius of the dashed circle be `x` cm.  

The area of the shaded annulus is the area inside the outer circle of radius 14 cm less the area inside the inner circle of radius 2 cm. Therefore this area is, in cm<sup>2</sup>,  

`π(14^2) − π(2^2) = 196π − 4π = 192π`.  

Similarly, the area between the dashed circle and the inner circle is, in cm<sup>2</sup>,  

`πx^2 − π(2^2) = (x^2 − 4)π`.  

Since the dashed circle divides the annulus into two equal areas, the area between the dashed circle and the inner circle is equal to half the area of the annulus. Half the area of the annulus is, in cm<sup>2</sup>, `192π ÷ 2 = 96π`. Therefore  

`(x^2 − 4)π = 96π`.  

It follows that  

`x^2 − 4 = 96`,  

and hence that  

`x^2 = 100`.  

The number `x` is positive as it is the radius, in centimetres, of the dashed circle. It follows that `x = 10`. Hence the radius of the dashed circle is 10 cm.

Let the equal sides of the right-angled isosceles triangle have length `x` cm. Then the squares on these sides have area `x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the area of the square on the hypotenuse of the triangle is `(x^2 + x^2)` cm<sup>2</sup>, that is `2x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. Hence, the sum of the areas of the squares on all three sides of the triangle is `(x^2 + x^2 + 2x^2)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 4x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. It follows that `4x^2 = 72` and hence that `x^2 = 18`.  

The triangle is half of a square measuring `x` cm `× x` cm. Therefore the triangle has area `1/2 x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>.  

It follows that the area of the triangle is 9 cm<sup>2</sup>.

A list of positive integers has a median of 8, a mode of 9 and a mean of 10.  

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the list?

* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

---
Because the list has a mode of 9, the integer 9 must occur at least twice in the list. Therefore, as the mean is 10, the list must include at least one integer which is greater than 10.  

So the list includes at least three integers that are greater than 8. Because the median is 8, the list must also include at least three integers that are less than 8. It follows that there are at least six integers in the list.  

We now try and find a list of six integers with the required properties. We can suppose from what we already know that the list, in increasing order, is  

`p, q, r, 9, 9, u`  

where `r < 8` and `u > 10`.  

For this list to have median 8, we need to have `1/2 (r + 9) = 8`, and therefore `r = 7`. So the list, in increasing order is  

`p, q, 7, 9, 9, u`  

with `u > 10`.  

For this list to have mode 9, no other integer can occur more than once in the list. Therefore `p ≠ q` and `q ≠ 7`. So `p < q < 7`.  

For this list to have mean 10, we need to have `p + q + 7 + 9 + 9 + u = 6 × 10 = 60`, that is, `p + q + u + 25 = 60`.  

Therefore we require that `p + q + u = 35`, with `p < q < 7`, and `u > 10`.  

There is more than one way to choose `p`, `q` and `u` so as to meet these conditions. For example, the list  

5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 24  

has a median of 8, a mode of 9 and a mean of 10.  

We have found a list of 6 positive integers with the given properties. We have shown that no list of fewer than 6 positive integers has these properties. We conclude that the smallest possible number of integers in the list is 6.

Let `P`, `Q` be the midpoints of the longer sides of the rectangle. Let `R`, `S` be the points where the semicircles meet. Let `T` be the point where `PQ` meets `RS`.  

Each of the semicircles has radius 5 cm. Therefore `PR`, `PS`, `QR` and `QS` all have length 5 cm. Therefore `PSQR` is a rhombus. Hence the diagonals `PQ` and `RS` bisect each other at right angles. It follows that `PT` and `QT` each have length 4 cm. Let the common length of `RT` and `ST` be `x` cm.  

We now apply Pythagoras’ Theorem to the right-angled triangle `PTR`. This gives `4^2 + x^2 = 5^2`, and hence `x^2 = 5^2 − 4^2 = 25 − 16 = 9`. Therefore `x = 3`. It follows that both `RT` and `ST` have length 3 cm. Hence the length of `RS` is 6 cm. Therefore the width of the overlap of the two semicircles is 6 cm.

We let `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`, `V` and `W` be the vertices of the regular octagon. Let `K`, `L`, `M` and `N` be the points where the diagonals `PS` and `WT` meet the diagonals `QV` and `RU`, as shown in the diagram.  

Because `PQRSTUVW` is a regular octagon, `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT` are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles. We choose units so that the shorter sides of these triangles have length 1.

Then, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the hypotenuse of each of these triangles has length `√1^2 + 1^2 = √2`. Since the octagon is regular, it follows that each of its sides has length `√2`.  

Each of the triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, forms half of a square with side length 1, and so has area `1/2`.  

The shaded trapezium is made up of the two triangles `QKP` and `WNV`, each of area `1/2`, together with the rectangle `KNWP` which has area `√2 × 1 = √2`. Therefore the area of the shaded trapezium is `2 × 1/2 + √2 = 1 + √2`.  

The octagon is made up of the four triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, each with area `1/2`, the four rectangles `KNWP`, `RLKQ`, `MUVN` and `STML`, each with area `√2`, and the central square `KLMN` which has area `√2 × √2 = 2`. Therefore the area of the octagon is `4 × 1/2 + 4 × √2 + 2 = 4 + 4√2 = 4(1 + √2)`.  

It follows that the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the octagon is `1 + √2 : 4(1 + √2) = 1 : 4`.

Each truth teller must be sitting between two liars. Each liar must be sitting next to at least one truth teller and may be sitting between two truth tellers.  

The largest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting between two truth tellers and each truth teller is sitting between two liars. In this case the truth tellers and liars alternate around the table. So half (that is, 1008) of the people are truth tellers and half (1008) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is even.  

The smallest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting next to just one truth teller and so is sitting between a truth teller and a liar. In this case as you go round the table there is one truth teller, then two liars, then one truth teller, then two liars and so on. So one-third (672) of the people are truth tellers and two-thirds (1374) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is divisible by 3.  

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of people who could be telling the truth is 1008 − 672 = 336.

We see from the diagram that the quarter circles touch. Let the points where they touch be `K`, `L`, `M` and `N`. Let the centres of the quarter circles be `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S`, arranged as shown in the diagram.  

Because the circles touch, `PKQ`, `QLR`, `RMS` and `SNP` are straight lines.  

Since `S` is the centre of the quarter circle that goes through `M` and `N`, we have `SM = SN` and `∠MSN = 90°`. Therefore `MSN` is a right-angled isosceles triangle. The length of the hypotenuse NM of this triangle is the width of the design, that is, 2 cm.

Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `SMN`, we see that `SM` and `SN` each have length `√2` cm.  

Similarly `MR` and `NP` both have length `√2` cm. Therefore `SPR` is a right-angled isosceles triangle in which both `SR` and `SP` have length `2√2` cm. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `SPR`, the hypotenuse `PR` of this triangle has length 4 cm.  

[Alternatively, we could argue that `SNM` and `SPR` are similar triangles in which `SP` is twice the length of `SN`. Therefore `PR` is twice the length of `NM`.]  

The line segment `PR` is made up of two radii of the quarter circles with centres `P` and `R`, which have total length `2√2` cm, and a diameter of the small circle. It follows that the diameter of the small circle has length `4` cm `− 2√2` cm. The radius of the small circle is half of this, that is, `(2 − √2)` cm.

Every day, Aimee goes up an escalator on her journey to work. If she stands still, it takes her 60 seconds to travel from the bottom to the top. One day the escalator was broken so she had to walk up it. This took her 90 seconds.  

How many seconds would it take her to travel up the escalator if she walked up at the same speed as before while it was working?

We suppose that the distance from the bottom to the top of the escalator is `d` metres.  

Since it takes Aimee 60 seconds to travel this distance when she stands still, the escalator moves upwards at a speed of `d/60` metres per second.  

Since it takes Aimee 90 seconds to walk from the bottom to the top of the escalator when it is not moving, Aimee walks up the escalator at a speed of `d/90` metres per second.  

It follows that when Aimee is walking at the same speed up the moving escalator she is moving at a speed of `(d/60 + d/90)` metres per second. Now  

(d/60 + d/90) = d(1/60 + 1/90) = d ((3 + 2)/180) = d (5/180) = d/36.  

So Aimee moves up the escalator at a speed of `d/36` metres per second. At this speed it takes Aimee 36 seconds to travel the `d` metres up the escalator.

We see that the entire plane can be tessellated by the shape labelled `S` in the above diagram. This shape is made up of one tile in the shape of a regular hexagon and two tiles in the shape of equilateral triangles.  

The diagram shows that, as the side length of the triangular tiles is half that of the hexagonal tiles, the area of the hexagonal tiles is 24 times the area of the triangular tiles.  

[This may be seen by counting the number of small triangles, each congruent to the triangular tiles, into which the hexagonal tile is divided by the dashed lines.  

Alternatively, we see that the hexagonal tile may be divided into 6 equilateral triangles each with side length twice that of the triangular tiles, and hence each with an area 4 times that of the triangular tiles. It follows that the area of the hexagonal tile is 6 `×` 4, that is, 24, times that of the triangular tiles.]  

Therefore the shape `S` is made up of 2 black triangles and a hexagon equal in area to 24 of the black triangles. So the total area of `S` is equal to that of 2 + 24 = 26 of the triangles.  

It follows that the fraction of the area of `S` that is black is `2/26 = 1/13`.  

A large area of the floor will be covered by a large number of tiles which make up shapes congruent to `S`, together with a few bits of tiles. Therefore the fraction of the floor that is shaded black will be very close to `1/13`.
