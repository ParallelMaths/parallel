Let `P`, `Q` be the midpoints of the longer sides of the rectangle. Let `R`, `S` be the points where the semicircles meet. Let `T` be the point where `PQ` meets `RS`.  

Each of the semicircles has radius 5 cm. Therefore `PR`, `PS`, `QR` and `QS` all have length 5 cm. Therefore `PSQR` is a rhombus. Hence the diagonals `PQ` and `RS` bisect each other at right angles. It follows that `PT` and `QT` each have length 4 cm. Let the common length of `RT` and `ST` be `x` cm.  

We now apply Pythagoras’ Theorem to the right-angled triangle `PTR`. This gives `4^2 + x^2 = 5^2`, and hence `x^2 = 5^2 − 4^2 = 25 − 16 = 9`. Therefore `x = 3`. It follows that both `RT` and `ST` have length 3 cm. Hence the length of `RS` is 6 cm. Therefore the width of the overlap of the two semicircles is 6 cm.

The diagram shows a regular octagon.  

What is the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the whole octagon?

* [x] 1 : 4
* [ ] 5 : 16
* [ ] 1 : 3
* [ ] √2 : 2
* [ ] 3 : 8

We let `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`, `V` and `W` be the vertices of the regular octagon. Let `K`, `L`, `M` and `N` be the points where the diagonals `PS` and `WT` meet the diagonals `QV` and `RU`, as shown in the diagram.  

Because `PQRSTUVW` is a regular octagon, `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT` are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles. We choose units so that the shorter sides of these triangles have length 1.

Then, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the hypotenuse of each of these triangles has length `sqrt(1)^2 + 1^2 = sqrt(2)`. Since the octagon is regular, it follows that each of its sides has length `sqrt(2)`.  

Each of the triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, forms half of a square with side length 1, and so has area `1/2`.  

The shaded trapezium is made up of the two triangles `QKP` and `WNV`, each of area `1/2`, together with the rectangle `KNWP` which has area `sqrt(2) × 1 = sqrt(2)`. Therefore the area of the shaded trapezium is `2 × 1/2 + sqrt(2) = 1 + sqrt(2)`.  

The octagon is made up of the four triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, each with area `1/2`, the four rectangles `KNWP`, `RLKQ`, `MUVN` and `STML`, each with area `sqrt(2)`, and the central square `KLMN` which has area `sqrt(2) × sqrt(2) = 2`. Therefore the area of the octagon is `4 × 1/2 + 4 × sqrt(2) + 2 = 4 + 4 sqrt(2) = 4(1 + sqrt(2))`.  

It follows that the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the octagon is `1 + sqrt(2) : 4(1 + sqrt(2)) = 1 : 4`.

In a particular group of people, some always tell the truth, the rest always lie. There are 2016 in the group. One day, the group is sitting in a circle. Each person in the group says, "Both the person on my left and the person on my right are liars."  

What is the difference between the largest and smallest number of people who could be telling the truth?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 72
* [ ] 126
* [ ] 288
* [x] 336
{.col-5}

Each truth teller must be sitting between two liars. Each liar must be sitting next to at least one truth teller and may be sitting between two truth tellers.  

The largest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting between two truth tellers and each truth teller is sitting between two liars. In this case the truth tellers and liars alternate around the table. So half (that is, 1008) of the people are truth tellers and half (1008) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is even.  

The smallest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting next to just one truth teller and so is sitting between a truth teller and a liar. In this case as you go round the table there is one truth teller, then two liars, then one truth teller, then two liars and so on. So one-third (672) of the people are truth tellers and two-thirds (1374) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is divisible by 3.  

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of people who could be telling the truth is 1008 − 672 = 336.

The diagram shows a heptagon with a line of three circles on each side. Each circle is to contain exactly one number. The numbers 8 to 14 are distributed as shown and the numbers 1 to 7 are to be distributed to the remaining circles. The total of the numbers in each of the lines of three circles is to be the same.  

What is this total?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `2 - sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `1/2 sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `5 - 3 sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `2 sqrt(2) - 2`

We see from the diagram that the quarter circles touch. Let the points where they touch be `K`, `L`, `M` and `N`. Let the centres of the quarter circles be `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S`, arranged as shown in the diagram.  

Because the circles touch, `PKQ`, `QLR`, `RMS` and `SNP` are straight lines.  

Since `S` is the centre of the quarter circle that goes through `M` and `N`, we have `SM = SN` and `∠MSN = 90°`. Therefore `MSN` is a right-angled isosceles triangle. The length of the hypotenuse NM of this triangle is the width of the design, that is, 2 cm.

Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `SMN`, we see that `SM` and `SN` each have length `sqrt(2)` cm.  

Similarly `MR` and `NP` both have length `sqrt(2)` cm. Therefore `SPR` is a right-angled isosceles triangle in which both `SR` and `SP` have length `2 sqrt(2)` cm. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the triangle `SPR`, the hypotenuse `PR` of this triangle has length 4 cm.  

[Alternatively, we could argue that `SNM` and `SPR` are similar triangles in which `SP` is twice the length of `SN`. Therefore `PR` is twice the length of `NM`.]  

The line segment `PR` is made up of two radii of the quarter circles with centres `P` and `R`, which have total length `2 sqrt(2)` cm, and a diameter of the small circle. It follows that the diameter of the small circle has length `4` cm `− 2 sqrt(2)` cm. The radius of the small circle is half of this, that is, `(2 − sqrt(2))` cm.
