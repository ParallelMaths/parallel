The diagram shows a regular octagon.  

What is the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the whole octagon?

* [x] 1 : 4
* [ ] 5 : 16
* [ ] 1 : 3
* [ ] `sqrt(2)` : 2
* [ ] 3 : 8

We let `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`, `V` and `W` be the vertices of the regular octagon. Let `K`, `L`, `M` and `N` be the points where the diagonals `PS` and `WT` meet the diagonals `QV` and `RU`, as shown in the diagram.  

Because `PQRSTUVW` is a regular octagon, `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT` are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles. We choose units so that the shorter sides of these triangles have length 1.

Then, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the hypotenuse of each of these triangles has length `sqrt(1)^2 + 1^2 = sqrt(2)`. Since the octagon is regular, it follows that each of its sides has length `sqrt(2)`.  

Each of the triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, forms half of a square with side length 1, and so has area `1/2`.  

The shaded trapezium is made up of the two triangles `QKP` and `WNV`, each of area `1/2`, together with the rectangle `KNWP` which has area `sqrt(2) × 1 = sqrt(2)`. Therefore the area of the shaded trapezium is `2 × 1/2 + sqrt(2) = 1 + sqrt(2)`.  

The octagon is made up of the four triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, each with area `1/2`, the four rectangles `KNWP`, `RLKQ`, `MUVN` and `STML`, each with area `sqrt(2)`, and the central square `KLMN` which has area `sqrt(2) × sqrt(2) = 2`. Therefore the area of the octagon is `4 × 1/2 + 4 × sqrt(2) + 2 = 4 + 4 sqrt(2) = 4(1 + sqrt(2))`.  

It follows that the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the octagon is `1 + sqrt(2) : 4(1 + sqrt(2)) = 1 : 4`.

In a particular group of people, some always tell the truth, the rest always lie. There are 2016 in the group. One day, the group is sitting in a circle. Each person in the group says, "Both the person on my left and the person on my right are liars."  

What is the difference between the largest and smallest number of people who could be telling the truth?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 72
* [ ] 126
* [ ] 288
* [x] 336

Each truth teller must be sitting between two liars. Each liar must be sitting next to at least one truth teller and may be sitting between two truth tellers.  

The largest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting between two truth tellers and each truth teller is sitting between two liars. In this case the truth tellers and liars alternate around the table. So half (that is, 1008) of the people are truth tellers and half (1008) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is even.  

The smallest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting next to just one truth teller and so is sitting between a truth teller and a liar. In this case as you go round the table there is one truth teller, then two liars, then one truth teller, then two liars and so on. So one-third (672) of the people are truth tellers and two-thirds (1374) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is divisible by 3.  

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of people who could be telling the truth is 1008 − 672 = 336.
