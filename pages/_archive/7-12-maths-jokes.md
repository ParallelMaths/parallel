# _Year 7 • Parallelogram 12_ Maths Jokes

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

There are only 4 more Parallelograms this year, as we will be starting our summer break at half-term. If you score highly enough in these last 4 Parallelograms (#12, #13, #14, #15) and complete them by June 1 then you will receive a Parallel certificate. An average of more than 40% in these four Parallelograms wins a bronze certificate, then 60% or more wins silver and 80% or more wins gold.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
* Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
* Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Maths jokes

It sounds odd, but there are maths jokes. Lots of jokes. In fact, lots of
mathematicians are very funny. Some of my favourite comedians (Dara O'Briain,
Romesh Ranganathan and Dave Gorman) studied maths at university, and I have
written a whole book about the mathematicians who write The Simpsons.  

So, how good is your mathematical sense of humour? And how much maths do you
know? Below are 4 jokes with 3 punchlines each. Can you spot the punchline? You
will need to a bit of maths in order to work out the right answer.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=0.5
__1.1__ Why is 6 afraid of 7?

* [ ] Because 1, 2, 3
* [x] Because 7, 8, 9
* [ ] Because 5 predates 6

---
The correct answer is (b), because it sounds like ”7 ate 9”.
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=0.5
__1.2__ What are the 10 kinds of people in the world?

* [ ] Set 0, Set 1, Set 2, …, Set 9
* [ ] α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ
* [x] Those who understand binary, and those who don’t

---
In binary 10 = 2, so 10 kinds of people could mean 2 kinds of people. (If you haven’t covered binary maths yet then you have something to look forward to.)
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=0.5
__1.3__ What does the “B” in Benoit B Mandelbrot stand for?

* [x] Benoit B Mandelbrot
* [ ] Binomial
* [ ] Breviation

---

This was a tough one. Benoit B Mandelbrot helped developed the mathematics of
fractals, which are structures or shapes that appear similar when you zoom in or
zoom out. Trees, clouds and certain mathematical shapes are fractal, as shown above. The bit of the tree in the red box looks just like the whole tree…
and you can zoom in even further and see more and more micro-replicas of the whole
tree.

The following video shows what happens if you zoom into the so-called Mandelbrot Set, and you see the same pattern (a sort of seahorse’s tail) reappearing again, and again, and again:

So, returning to the joke, the B represents Benoit B Mandelbrot, because zooming into the name
gives you the whole name again.

::: problem id=1_4 marks=0.5
__1.4__ Why did the chicken cross the Möbius strip?

* [x] To get to the other… er…?
* [ ] To reach a finite conclusion
* [ ] To integrate itself into the tarmac

---

![](/resources/7-12-maths-jokes/mobius.jpg)

Another toughie – a Möbius strip is a strange mathematical shape which only has
one side, so you can’t get to the other side. As shown here, it is just a loop
with a single twist, but if you imagine running your finger along one side of
the loop you will find that your finger covers every bit of the loop... so it
only has one side. Möbius strips are fantastic, one of my favourite bits of
geometry, and we’ll return to them in next year’s Parallelogram series.

## 2. Mini cross-number

::: problem id=2 marks=2
__2__ A cross-number is like a crossword, but with numbers instead of letters. Solve the clues to find the digit `x` in this cross-number.

<table><tr><td>

![](/resources/7-12-maths-jokes/crossnumber.png)

</td><td>

__Across__  
__1.__ A cube  
__3.__ A cube

</td><td>

__Down__  
__1.__ One less than a cube  
__2.__ A number

</td></tr></table>

_x_ = <input type="text" solution="4"/>

^^^ hint id=1
1 across, 3 across & 1 down are all cubes (or one less than a cube) and they are all 2-digit numbers, which means they are between 10 and 99. There are not very many cube numbers between 10 and 99, so start by writing them down and then see how they might fit into the grid.
^^^

---
The correct answer is _x_ = 4.

1 across, 3 across & 1 down are all cubes (or one less than a cube) and they are
all 2-digit numbers, which means they are between 10 and 99. The only cube
numbers between 10 and 99 are 27 and 64. So 1 across and 3 across must be 27 and
64, or 64 and 27. Meanwhile, 1 down must be 26 or 63. The cross-number only
works if 1 down is 26, because 3 across can then be 64, which means _x_ = 4.

## 3. Maryam’s inspiration

![](/resources/7-12-maths-jokes/maryam-mirzakhani.png)

You might be surprised to know that there is no Nobel Prize for maths. However,
there is an even bigger prize for mathematicians, which is called the Fields
Medal. It is only given every 4 years, so it is very rare and precious.

In 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman to win a Fields Medal, but tragically she died just three years later. The Iranian-born NASA scientist, Firouz Naderi, wrote: “A light was turned off today, it breaks my heart... Gone far too soon.”

Commenting on her own brilliant work with Alex Eskin, Mirzakhani commented: “If we knew things would be so complicated, I think we would have given up... I don’t know, actually. I don’t know. I don’t give up easily.”

Mirzakhani was born in Iran and then worked in America, and you can find out about her life and work in the short video below.

Not surprisingly, Maryam talks about some incredibly complex maths, so don’t
worry if you find it confusing. In fact, if you think you understand what Maryam
is describing, then you probably don’t. Watch it carefully and answer the
question below.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
__3.1__ What indoor sport does Maryam mention in one of her mathematical
examples?

* [ ] Chess
* [ ] Darts
* [x] Billiards
* [ ] Table tennis

---
Maryam talks about a problem involving the path of a ball bouncing around a
billiard table.

![](/resources/7-12-maths-jokes/gauss.png)

Maryam has said that she first became fired up about mathematics when her big
brother told her a story about the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.
When Gauss was a schoolboy, his teacher tried to keep the class busy by asking
them to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100.

However, before the teacher had even left the room, Gauss’s hand shot up and he
announced that the answer was 5,050.

Gauss was right, but how did he add up the first 100 numbers in just a few
seconds?

Here is Gauss's trick in three stages:  
1.	Pair up all the numbers in the following way and add them up:
	1 + 100 = 101,  
	2 + 99 = 101,  
	3 + 98 = 101  
	…
	50 + 51 = 101
2.	So, you have 50 pairs of numbers, which all add up to 101.
3. 	So, the result is 50 × 101 = 5,050!

Another way to think about this is:

`"Sum from 1 to n" = n/2 × (n+1)` {.text-center}

* `(n+1)` represents step 1, because you pair up all the numbers, so that all
  the pairs add up to `(n+1)`.  
* `n/2` represents step 2, because the number of pairs is equal to the total
  number of numbers divided by 2.  
* × represents step 3, because you then multiply the sum of each pair by
  the number of pairs.

Let’s see if you can apply Gauss’s trick.

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ Add up all the numbers from 1 to 50

<input type="text" solution="1275"/>

---
The correct answer is 1275.
:::

::: problem id=3_3 marks=1
__3.3__ Add up all the numbers from 1 to 1,000

<input type="text" solution="500500"/>

---
The correct answer is 500500.

If you got either of these questions wrong, then take a look at
[this website](https://betterexplained.com/articles/techniques-for-adding-the-numbers-1-to-100/){target="_blank"},
which goes into more detail about ways of adding the numbers from 1 to 100, and
is worth looking at.

## 4. Domino toppling

I watched this terrific video last week. Take a look and answer the question
afterwards.

@[youtube](5JCm5FY-dEY?rel=0)

::: problem id=4 marks=1
__4__ Starting with 5mm tall domino, roughly how many dominoes would you need to knock
down the Empire State Building?

* [x] 30
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 30,000
* [ ] 100,000,000
:::

Each domino can knock over a domino that 1.5 times bigger, which does not seem
big, but when this happens over and over again then the dominoes get bigger and
bigger very quickly. This is known as exponential growth and we will return to
this in a future Parallelogram.

In the meantime, here is an even more extraordinary example of domino toppling
where the dominos get bigger and bigger. In fact, it was a world record at the
time.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge

::: problem id=5 marks=1
__5__ Consider the following three statements:

(i) Doubling a positive number always makes it larger.  
(ii) Squaring a positive number always makes it larger.  
(iii) Taking the positive square root of a positive number always makes it smaller.  

Which statements are true?

* [ ] All three
* [ ] None
* [x] Only (i)
* [ ] (i) and (ii)
* [ ] (ii) and (iii)

---
The correct answer is just (i).

Statement (i) is true since `2x > x`, if `x > 0`.  

Statement (ii) is not true. For example, (½)<sup>2</sup> = ¼, which is not
larger than ½. Also, 1<sup>2</sup> is not bigger than 1.

Statement (iii) is also not true. For example, √¼ = ½, which is not smaller
than ¼. Also, √1 is not bigger than 1.

## 6. Weird optical illusions

The amazing, mind-warping objects in this video have been created by
mathematical artist and engineer Professor Kokichi Sugihara. These incredible
illusions literally mess with your brain.  

Sometimes the geometry that you study at school might seem ordinary – what could
be more ordinary than the angles of a triangle or the symmetry of a square? –
but your teachers are really providing you with the first stepping stones towards
gaining an understanding of the nature of space, and how you can build the sort
of flabbergasting structures in this video. There is one question afterwards and
then you can hit the submit button.

@[youtube](Wx4yi5m8IfI?rel=0)

::: problem id=6 marks=1
__6__ Professor Sugihara’s work could help:

* [x] Drivers
* [ ] Architects
* [ ] Surgeons
{.col-3}

---
The correct answer is (a), because drivers can make errors if their brains are
fooled by an optical illusion caused by the geometry of the road.
