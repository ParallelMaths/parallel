# Summer Problems #3

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the third of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.



## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
A rectangular sheet of paper is divided into two pieces by a single straight cut. One of the pieces is then further divided into two, also by a single straight cut.

Which of the following could _not_ be the total number of edges of the resulting three pieces?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 12
* [x] 13
{.col-5}

---

The diagrams below show how the total number of edges of the resulting three pieces may be 9, 10, 11 or 12.

However, 12 is the maximum value of the total number of edges since the original number of edges is four and any subsequent cut adds a maximum of four edges (by dividing two existing edges and adding the new ‘cuts’).

The parallelogram `WXYZ` shown in the diagram on the right has been divided into nine smaller parallelograms. The perimeters, in centimetres, of four of the smaller parallelograms are shown.

The perimeter of `WXYZ` is 21 cm.

What is the perimeter of the shaded parallelogram?

* [ ] 5 cm
* [ ] 6 cm
* [x] 7 cm
* [ ] 8 cm
* [ ] 9 cm

Let the lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` be as shown in the diagram.

Then the sum of the perimeters of the four labelled parallelograms is `2(a + e) + 2(b + d) + 2(b + f ) + 2(c + e) = 2 (a + b + c + d + e + f ) + 2 (b + e)` = perimeter of `WXYZ` + perimeter of shaded parallelogram.

So the perimeter of the shaded parallelogram is ((11 + 8 + 4 + 5) − 21) cm = 7 cm.

And that’s the end of the third Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
