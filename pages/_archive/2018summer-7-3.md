# Summer Problems #3

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the third of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
When the following fractions are put in their correct places on the number line, which
fraction is in the middle?

* [x] -`1/7`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] -`1/5`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] -`1/3`
{.col-5}

---

When put in their correct places on the number line, the order of the fractions
is: -`1/3`, -`1/5`, -`1/7`, `1/6`, `1/4`.

![](/resources/2018summer-7-3/5-numbers-question.gif){image align="right"}
I choose three numbers from this number square, including one number from each row and one number from each column. I then multiply the three numbers together.

What is the largest possible product?

* [ ] 72
* [ ] 96
* [x] 105
* [ ] 162
* [ ] 504
{.col-5}

---

We consider the different possible choices from the top row. If 1 is chosen, then the options are 1, 5, 9 and 1, 6, 8 giving products 45 and 48 respectively.

If 2 is chosen, the options are 2, 4, 9 and 2, 6, 7 giving products 72 and 84 respectively.

Finally, if 3 is chosen, the options are 3, 4, 8 and 3, 5, 7 giving products 96 and 105. So 105 is the maximum.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
A list of ten numbers contains two of each of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The two 0s are next
to each other, the two 1s are separated by one number, the two 2s by two numbers, the two
3s by three numbers and the two 4s by four numbers. The list starts 3, 4, ... . What is the
last number?

* [ ] 0
* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

---
Let the list be `3, 4, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h`. We can see that `c = 3` and `e = 4`. So the list now reads `3, 4, a, b, 3, d, 4, f, g, h`.

Now, the only pairs of letters two apart from each other are `a, d` and `d, g`. Therefore `d = 2` and the list is `3, 4, a, b, 3, 2, 4, f, g, h`.

The only pair now one apart are `f, h`. The list is `3, 4, a, b, 3, 2, 4, 1, g, 1`.

Now `a, b` are the only pair zero apart. So `a = b = 0` and `g = 2`

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
The pages of a book are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... . In total, it takes 852 digits to number all the
pages of the book. What is the number of the last page?

* [ ] 215
* [ ] 314
* [x] 320
* [ ] 329
* [ ] 422
{.col-5}

---
Pages 1 to 9 inclusive require 9 digits; pages 10 to 99 inclusive require 180 digits. So, in total, 189 digits are required to number all of the pages before the three-digit page numbers commence with page number 100.

This leaves 663 digits, so the last page in the book is the 221st page which has a three-digit number, namely page 320.

And that’s the end of the third Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
