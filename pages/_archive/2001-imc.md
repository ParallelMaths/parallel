__2.__ A tourist attraction which opens every day needs 30,000 visitors per day on average to break even. Last week there were 120,000 visitors. What is the number of visitors needed this week to break even over the two-week period?

Over a two-week period, the required number of visitors is 14 × 30,000 = 420,000. Hence the number required this week is 420,000 = 120,000 = 300,000.

Since `1/4 = 4/16` and `1/8 = 2/16`, the number midway between them is `3/16`.

Angle PSR = 41° (opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal). Therefore `x = 41 + 83` because the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.

The number of complete days which have elapsed is 366 + 31 ≈ 400.

![](/resources/2001-imc/10-pentagon-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
The interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108°.  

Therefore each interior angle of the regular polygon formed by the inner sides of the pentagons is (360 - 2 × 108)° = 144°.  

The exterior angle of this regular polygon 36° and hence it has 360 ÷ 36, ie 10 sides.  

Therefore 7 more pentagons are required.

Imagine that the card is transparent. Then, after the first rotation the shape on the card will look like shape __C__. The diagonal line now runs North-East to South-West, and so it will appear the same after the second rotation.  

The line which runs North-South on the left of the figure will run East-West at the bottom of the figure after this second rotation, while the line which runs North-South on the right of the figure will run East-West at the top of the figure.  

Thus the final appearance will be shape __B__.

__12.1__ A long-sleeve shirt has 8 front buttons and 2 cuff buttons; a short-sleeve shirt has 6 front buttons and no cuff buttons. The factory which makes 'Slimboy Shirts' uses 10 times as many front buttons as cuff buttons. What is the ratio of long-sleeve shirts to short-sleeve shirts produced by the factory?

---

Every long-sleeve shirt requires 2 cuff buttons; hence for every one long-sleeve shirt produced by the factory, a total of 20 front buttons are used. The long-sleeve shirt requires 8 of these and therefore the remaining 12 will be the front buttons on 2 short-sleeve shirts. Thus the required ratio is 1:2.

The general form of the example given is `1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) + ... + 5 + 3 + 1 = (n - 1)^2 + n^2`.  

Therefore, for `n = 1001`:  

`1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 1999 + 2001 + 1999 + ... + 5 + 3 + 1 = 1000^2 + 1001^2`.

Let the athlete take `x` minutes to cycle one mile. Then he takes `(3x)/2` minutes to run one mile, and `3x` minutes to walk one mile. Therefore: `3x + (3x)/2 + x = 3x = 10`, ie `x = 4`.  

The cyclist takes 12 minutes to walk the first mile, 6 minutes to run the second mile and 4 minutes to cycle the third mile: a total time of 22 minutes.

The ratio of length:breadth of the smaller rectangles is 5:4. Let the length and breadth of these rectangles be `5x` cm and `4x` cm respectively. The area of the large rectangle, in cm<sup>2</sup>, is `9 × 20x^2 = 180x^2` and the only one of the alternative which is a product of 180 and a perfect square is 1620, which corresponds to `x = 3`.

Note that the sum of the whole numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive is 45, a multiple of 3.  

Thus the stated problem may be reduced to finding the number of ways of choosing two of these numbers whose sum is a multiple of 3.  

There are 12 ways of doing this: 1, 2; 1, 5; 1, 8; 2, 4; 2, 7; 3, 6; 3, 9; 4, 5; 4, 8; 5, 7; 6, 9; 7, 8.

Note that `(n + 3)/(n - 1) = (n - 1)/(n - 1) + 4/(n - 1) = 1 + 4/(n - 1)`.  

Thus `(n + 3)/(n - 1)` is an integer if and only if `n - 1` divides exactly into 4 (or -4).

__24.1__ A 4 by 4 'antimagic square' is an arrangement of the numbers 1 to 16 inclusive in a square, so that the totals of each of the four rows and four columns and two main diagonals are ten consecutive numbers in some order.  

The diagram shows an incomplete antimagic square.  

When it is completed, what number will replace the asterisk?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 8
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
{.col-5}

---

The totals of the top row and the completed main diagonal are 30 and 39 respectively, and therefore the ten consecutive numbers in question must be those from 30 to 39 inclusive.  

The number in the bottom right-hand corner must be one of 1, 2, 8, 15 or 16. Taking 1 or 2 makes the diagonal (from top left to bottom right) add up to less than 30, while taking 15 or 16 produces a total greater than 39. Hence 8 must go in the bottom right-hand corner.  

It now follows that * must be replaced by 15, since if 15 is placed in one of the other three vacant squares, we get a total of 45 (second column, too big), 34 (third column, same as diagonal) or 47 (third row, too big).

Let `O` be the centre of the circle and let the points where the arcs meet be `C` and `D` respectively. `ABCD` is a square since its sides are all equal to the radius of the arc `CD` and `ACB = 90deg` (angle in a semicircle).  

In triangle `OCB`, `CB^2 = OC^2 + OB^2`, hence `CB = sqrt(2)` cm.  

The area of the segment bounded by arc `CD` and diameter `CD` is equal to the area of sector `BCD` = the area of triangle `BCD`, ie:  

`(1/4 π (sqrt(2)^2) - 1/2 × sqrt(2) × sqrt(2))` cm<sup>2</sup>, ie `(1/2 π - 1)` cm<sup>2</sup>.

The unshaded area in the original figure is, therefore, `(π - 2)` cm<sup>2</sup>.  

Now the area of the circle is `(π)` cm<sup>2</sup> and hence the shaded area is `2` cm<sup>2</sup>.
