__5.1__ In the diagram the lines `PQ` and `SR` are parallel, as are the lines `PS` and `QT`. What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 139
* [ ] 138
* [x] 124
* [ ] 98
* [ ] 97

---

Angle PSR = 41° (opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal). Therefore `x = 41 + 83` because the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.

__6.1__ 2001 = 3 × 23 × 29. Which of the following numbers is also the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers?  

* [ ] 45
* [ ] 60
* [ ] 91
* [x] 105
* [ ] 330

105 = 3 × 5 × 7.

__7.1__ A ream of paper (500 sheets) is 5.4cm thick. What is the thickness of a single sheet, correct to one significant figure?

* [ ] 1mm
* [ ] 0.5mm
* [x] 0.1mm
* [ ] 0.05mm
* [ ] 0.01mm
{.col-5}

---

The thickness of one sheet = (54 ÷ 500) mm = (108 ÷ 1000) mm = 0.108 mm = 0.1mm to one significant figure.

__14.1__ A square patchwork quilt is made by joining four square pieces of cloth, with each piece coloured grey and white as shown.  

Only edges of the same colour are sewn together.  

How many different quilt patterns are possible?  

Two patters are considered to be the same if one can be rotated to look exactly like the other.

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 8

The only possible distinct patterns are:

__15.1__ How many of the following numbers are greater than 10?

- 3 sqrt(11)
- 4 sqrt(7)
- 5 sqrt(5)
- 6 sqrt(3)
- 7 sqrt(2)

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

- `3 sqrt(11) = sqrt(9) × sqrt(11) = sqrt(9 × 11) = sqrt(99)`;   
- `4 sqrt(7) = sqrt(16) × sqrt(7) = sqrt(16 × 7) = sqrt(112)`;  
- `5 sqrt(5) = sqrt(25) × sqrt(5) = sqrt(25 × 5) = sqrt(125)`;  
- `6 sqrt(3) = sqrt(36) × sqrt(3) = sqrt(36 × 3) = sqrt(108)`;  
- `7 sqrt(2) = sqrt(49) × sqrt(2) = sqrt(49 × 2) = sqrt(98)`;  

Hence 4 sqrt(7), 5 sqrt(5), and 6 sqrt(3) are all greater than 10.

__17.1__ Albert Einstein was standing on the station platform thinking about relativity when he noticed that he could see two station clocks. Each clock was digital, showing only hours and minutes. He observed that the display on one clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds before the correct time, whereas the display on the other clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds after the correct time. For what fraction of the day did the clocks show the same time?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `2/3`
* [ ] `5/6`
* [ ] `7/6`
{.col-5}

---

In each minute, the two clocks showed the same time for 40 seconds, ie they showed the same time for `40/60` of the day.

## 18.

::: problem id=18_1 marks=4
__18.1__ An athlete covers three consecutive miles by walking the first mile, running the second and cycling the third. He runs twice as fast as he walks, and he cycles one and a half times as fast as he runs. He takes ten minutes longer than he would do if he cycled three miles. How long does he take by walking, running and cycling?

* [ ] 60 min
* [ ] 42 min
* [ ] 36 min
* [ ] 30 min
* [x] 22 min
{.col-5}

---

Let the athlete take `x` minutes to cycle one mile. Then he takes `(3x)/2` minutes to run one mile, and `3x` minutes to walk one mile. Therefore: `3x + (3x)/2 + x = 3x = 10`, ie `x = 4`.  

The cyclist takes 12 minutes to walk the first mile, 6 minutes to run the second mile and 4 minutes to cycle the third mile: a total time of 22 minutes.

__19.1__ The diagram shows a large rectangle composed of nine identical smaller rectangles.  

Both the length and breadth of each of these smaller rectangles are whole numbers of centimetres.  

Which of the following could be the area of the large rectangle?

* [ ] 450 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 630 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 1260 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 1440 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 1620 cm<sup>2</sup>
{.col-5}

---

The ratio of length:breadth of the smaller rectangles is 5:4. Let the length and breadth of these rectangles be `5x` cm and `4x` cm respectively. The area of the large rectangle, in cm<sup>2</sup>, is `9 × 20x^2 = 180x^2` and the only one of the alternative which is a product of 180 and a perfect square is 1620, which corresponds to `x = 3`.

## 21.

::: problem id=21_1 marks=5
__21.1__ Given that `x` is positive and less than 1, which of the following numbers is the largest?

* [x] `x^2 + x`
* [ ] `x^2`
* [ ] `x^3`
* [ ] `x^3 + x^2`
* [ ] `x^4`
{.col-5}

---

Given that `0 < x < 1`, we may deduce that `x^2 + x > x^2 > x^3 > x^4` and also that `x^2 + x > x^2 + x^3`.
