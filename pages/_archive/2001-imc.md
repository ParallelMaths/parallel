__7.1__ A ream of paper (500 sheets) is 5.4cm thick. What is the thickness of a single sheet, correct to one significant figure?

* [ ] 1mm
* [ ] 0.5mm
* [x] 0.1mm
* [ ] 0.05mm
* [ ] 0.01mm
{.col-5}

The thickness of one sheet = (54 รท 500) mm = (108 รท 1000) mm = 0.108 mm = 0.1mm to one significant figure.

__17.1__ Albert Einstein was standing on the station platform thinking about relativity when he noticed that he could see two station clocks. Each clock was digital, showing only hours and minutes. He observed that the display on one clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds before the correct time, whereas the display on the other clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds after the correct time. For what fraction of the day did the clocks show the same time?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `2/3`
* [ ] `5/6`
* [ ] `7/6`
{.col-5}

In each minute, the two clocks showed the same time for 40 seconds, ie they showed the same time for `40/60` of the day.

__21.1__ Given that `x` is positive and less than 1, which of the following numbers is the largest?

* [x] `x^2 + x`
* [ ] `x^2`
* [ ] `x^3`
* [ ] `x^3 + x^2`
* [ ] `x^4`
{.col-5}

---

Given that `0 < x < 1`, we may deduce that `x^2 + x > x^2 > x^3 > x^4` and also that `x^2 + x > x^2 + x^3`.
