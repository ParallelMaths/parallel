__5.1__ In the diagram the lines `PQ` and `SR` are parallel, as are the lines `PS` and `QT`. What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 139
* [ ] 138
* [x] 124
* [ ] 98

---

Angle PSR = 41° (opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal). Therefore `x = 41 + 83` because the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.

* [ ] 0.5mm
* [x] 0.1mm
* [ ] 0.05mm
* [ ] 0.01mm

The thickness of one sheet = (54 ÷ 500) mm = (108 ÷ 1000) mm = 0.108 mm = 0.1mm to one significant figure.

__11.1__ A square card printed with the letter __N__ is held horizontally, as shown in the diagram, where the arrow indicates the direction of North.  

The card is turned over by rotating it through 180° about an axis running from East to West, and then turned over by rotating it through 180° about an axis running from North-East to South-West.  

How does the diagram on the card now look to a person facing North?

* [ ] A
* [x] B

Imagine that the card is transparent. Then, after the first rotation the shape on the card will look like shape __C__. The diagonal line now runs North-East to South-West, and so it will appear the same after the second rotation.  

The line which runs North-South on the left of the figure will run East-West at the bottom of the figure after this second rotation, while the line which runs North-South on the right of the figure will run East-West at the top of the figure.  

Thus the final appearance will be shape __B__.

::: problem id=12_1 marks=4
__12.1__ A long-sleeve shirt has 8 front buttons and 2 cuff buttons; a short-sleeve shirt has 6 front buttons and no cuff buttons. The factory which makes 'Slimboy Shirts' uses 10 times as many front buttons as cuff buttons. What is the ratio of long-sleeve shirts to short-sleeve shirts produced by the factory?

* [ ] 4 : 1
* [ ] 4 : 3
* [ ] 2 : 3
* [ ] 3 : 4
* [x] 1 : 2
{.col-5}

---

Every long-sleeve shirt requires 2 cuff buttons; hence for every one long-sleeve shirt produced by the factory, a total of 20 front buttons are used. The long-sleeve shirt requires 8 of these and therefore the remaining 12 will be the front buttons on 2 short-sleeve shirts. Thus the required ratio is 1:2.

__15.1__ How many of the following numbers are greater than 10?

- 3 sqrt(11)

- 6 sqrt(3)
- 7 sqrt(2)

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

- `3 sqrt(11) = sqrt(9) × sqrt(11) = sqrt(9 × 11) = sqrt(99)`;   
- `4 sqrt(7) = sqrt(16) × sqrt(7) = sqrt(16 × 7) = sqrt(112)`;  
- `5 sqrt(5) = sqrt(25) × sqrt(5) = sqrt(25 × 5) = sqrt(125)`;  
- `6 sqrt(3) = sqrt(36) × sqrt(3) = sqrt(36 × 3) = sqrt(108)`;  
- `7 sqrt(2) = sqrt(49) × sqrt(2) = sqrt(49 × 2) = sqrt(98)`;  

Hence 4 sqrt(7), 5 sqrt(5), and 6 sqrt(3) are all greater than 10.

## 17.

::: problem id=17_1 marks=4
__17.1__ Albert Einstein was standing on the station platform thinking about relativity when he noticed that he could see two station clocks. Each clock was digital, showing only hours and minutes. He observed that the display on one clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds before the correct time, whereas the display on the other clock changed to the next minute 10 seconds after the correct time. For what fraction of the day did the clocks show the same time?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `2/3`
* [ ] `5/6`
* [ ] `7/6`
{.col-5}

In each minute, the two clocks showed the same time for 40 seconds, ie they showed the same time for `40/60` of the day.

## 18.

::: problem id=18_1 marks=4
__18.1__ An athlete covers three consecutive miles by walking the first mile, running the second and cycling the third. He runs twice as fast as he walks, and he cycles one and a half times as fast as he runs. He takes ten minutes longer than he would do if he cycled three miles. How long does he take by walking, running and cycling?

* [ ] 60 min
* [ ] 42 min
* [ ] 36 min
* [ ] 30 min
* [x] 22 min
{.col-5}

---

Let the athlete take `x` minutes to cycle one mile. Then he takes `(3x)/2` minutes to run one mile, and `3x` minutes to walk one mile. Therefore: `3x + (3x)/2 + x = 3x = 10`, ie `x = 4`.  

The cyclist takes 12 minutes to walk the first mile, 6 minutes to run the second mile and 4 minutes to cycle the third mile: a total time of 22 minutes.

__19.1__ The diagram shows a large rectangle composed of nine identical smaller rectangles.  

Both the length and breadth of each of these smaller rectangles are whole numbers of centimetres.  

Which of the following could be the area of the large rectangle?

* [ ] 450 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 630 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 1260 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 1440 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 1620 cm<sup>2</sup>
{.col-5}

---

The ratio of length:breadth of the smaller rectangles is 5:4. Let the length and breadth of these rectangles be `5x` cm and `4x` cm respectively. The area of the large rectangle, in cm<sup>2</sup>, is `9 × 20x^2 = 180x^2` and the only one of the alternative which is a product of 180 and a perfect square is 1620, which corresponds to `x = 3`.

## 20.

::: problem id=20_1 marks=5
__20.1__ In how many different ways can seven different numbers be chosen from the numbers 1 to 9 inclusive so that the seven numbers have a total which is a multiple of 3?

* [ ] fewer than 10
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
* [x] 12
* [ ] more than 12
{.col-5}

---

Note that the sum of the whole numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive is 45, a multiple of 3.  

Thus the stated problem may be reduced to finding the number of ways of choosing two of these numbers whose sum is a multiple of 3.  

There are 12 ways of doing this: 1, 2; 1, 5; 1, 8; 2, 4; 2, 7; 3, 6; 3, 9; 4, 5; 4, 8; 5, 7; 6, 9; 7, 8.

## 21.

::: problem id=21_1 marks=5
__21.1__ Given that `x` is positive and less than 1, which of the following numbers is the largest?

* [x] `x^2 + x`
* [ ] `x^2`
* [ ] `x^3`
* [ ] `x^3 + x^2`
* [ ] `x^4`
{.col-5}

---

Given that `0 < x < 1`, we may deduce that `x^2 + x > x^2 > x^3 > x^4` and also that `x^2 + x > x^2 + x^3`.

## 23.

::: problem id=23_1 marks=5
__23.1__ For how many values of `n` are both `n` and `(n + 3)(n - 1)` integers?

* [ ] 7
* [x] 6
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 0
{.col-5}

---

Note that `(n + 3)/(n - 1) = (n - 1)/(n - 1) + 4/(n - 1) = 1 + 4/(n - 1)`.  

Thus `(n + 3)/(n - 1)` is an integer if and only if `n - 1` divides exactly into 4 (or -4).  

The values of `n` for which this is true are -3, -1, 0, 2, 3, and 5.
