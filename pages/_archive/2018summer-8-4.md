# Year 8: Summer Problems #4

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the fourth of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.

What is the value of `P + Q + R` in the multiplication on the right?

* [x] 13
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 9

---

The three-digit number `RRR` is equal to 111 multiplied by the single digit `R`.

So `PQPQ × R = 639027 ÷ 111 = 5757`. Now `PQPQ` equals the two-digit number `PQ` multiplied by 101.

So `PQ × R = 5757 ÷ 101 = 57`. The only ways in which 57 may be expressed as the product of a two-digit number and a single digit are 57 × 1 and 19 × 3.

So `P = 5`, `Q = 7`, `R = 1` or  `P = 1`, `Q = 9`, `R = 3`. In both cases, `P + Q + R = 13`.

And that’s the end of the fourth Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
