__3.1__ Professor Rosseforp has an unusual clock. The clock shows the correct time at noon, but the hands move anti-clockwise rather than clockwise.  

The clock is very accurate, however, so the hands move at the correct speeds.  

If you looked in a mirror at the Professor's clock at 1:30 pm, which of the following would you see?

* [x] ![](/resources/2005-imc/3-clocks-a.png)
* [ ] ![](/resources/2005-imc/3-clocks-b.png)

As the hands move anticlockwise, at 1:30 pm they would have the appearance they would normally have at 10:30.

So, as the clock is viewed in a mirror, it would have the appearance shown in the first image.

If a number is divisible by 6 then it must also be divisible by 2, so is even. ‘The sum of any two odd numbers is even’ is also true. However, not all multiples of 9 are odd (e.g. 18) and the sum of any two even numbers is even rather than odd, so two of the four statements are true.

The offer gives the purchaser two items for the price of one and a half items.

Let the sizes of the interior angles of the quadrilateral in the centre of the figure be `a°`, `b°`, `c°` and `d°`. Then `a + b + c + d = 360`.  

Each of these angles is vertically opposite to one of the unmarked angles in the four triangles, as shown. So the sum of the marked angles plus the four angles of the quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the interior angles of four triangles, that is 720°.  

Hence the sum of the marked angles is 720° − 360° = 360°.

__10.1__ Granny has taken up deep-sea fishing! Last week, she caught a fish so big that she had to cut it into three pieces (head, body and tail) in order to weigh it.  

The tail weighed 9kg and the head weighed the same as the tail plus one third of the body. The body weighed as much as the head and tail together.  

How much did the whole fish weigh?

* [ ] 18 kg
* [ ] 27 kg
* [x] 54 kg
* [ ] 77 kg
* [ ] 84 kg
{.col-5}

---

Let the weights in kg of the head and body of the fish be `h` and `b` respectively.  

Then and `h = 9 + 1/3b` and `b = h + 9`.  

So `b = 9 + 1/3 b + 9`, that is `2/3 b = 18`, which gives `b = 27`.  

Hence `h = 18`, so the whole fish weighed 54kg.

Considering the angles at B and E:

∠CBE = (180 - 75 - 60)° = 45°;   
∠DEB = (180 - 65 - 60)° = 55°.  

Therefore ∠GHB = (45 + 55)° = 100° (exterior angle theorem) and, using the same theorem, ∠HGC = (100 − 60)° = 40°.

Let `ABCD` be the cross-section of one of the stones, as shown.  

As `AD = BC`, `ABCD` is an isosceles trapezium with `∠ADC = ∠BCD`.  

If `∠ADC = ∠BCD = θ`, then `2θ` is the interior angle of a regular 20-sided polygon, namely `(180 - 360/20)°`, which equals `162°`. So `θ` is `81°`.

__17.1__ Platinum is a very rare metal, even rarer than gold. Its density is 21.45 g/cm`^3`.  

Assuming that the world production has been about 110 tonnes for each of the past 50 years, and negligible before that, which of the following has a comparable volume to that of the total amount of platinum ever produced?


* [ ] a shoe box
* [ ] a cupboard
* [x] a house
* [ ] Buckingham Palace
* [ ] the Grand Canyon
{.col-5}

---

The volume of 1kg of platinum is (1000/21.45)cm`^3`, that is approximately 50cm`^3`.  

So 1 tonne of platinum has a volume of approximately 50,000cm`^3`, which is 1/20m`^3`.  

The volume of platinum produced per year is therefore about 5m3 and the total volume of platinum ever produced is approximately 250m`^3`.  

This is the volume of a cuboid measuring 10m × 5m × 5m, which is comparable to a house.

For ease of reference, label the points A, B, C,…, K as shown.  

First note that A = 3 and K = 9 or vice versa. With no loss of generality, let A = 3. Then the only possible values for B, C, and D are 7, 8 and 2 respectively. This gives E = 1 or 4 and, as K = 9, J = 1 or 6.  

If J = 1, then E = 4 and the only remaining possibilities for I, H and G are 5, 10 and 11 respectively.  

This means that F = 6, but 11 + 6 is not a triangle number, so J is not 1 and must, therefore, be 6. This means that
I = 4 and hence E = 1.  

The remaining values may now be assigned: H = 11, G = 10 and F = 5.

Let the number of cases solved in 2003 be `x`. Then, as this was 80% of the number of cases, there were `5x/4` cases to solve in 2003. So the number of cases to solve in 2004 was `5x/4 × 6/5`, which is `3x/2`.  

Inspector Remorse solved 60% of these cases, that is `3x/2 × 3/5`, which is `9x/10`.  

So the change in the number of cases solved was a 10% decrease.

__24.1__ The figure shows a cube of side 1 on which all twelve face diagonals have been drawn - creating a network with 14 vertices (the original eight corners, plus the six face centres) and 36 edges (the original twelve edges of the cube plus four extra edges on each face).  

What is the length of the shortest path along the edges of the network which passes through all 14 vertices?

* [x] `1 + 6sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `4 + 2sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `6`
* [ ] `8 + 6sqrt(2)`

{.col-5}

---

Figure (i) shows a net of the cube on which a possible path has been drawn, while figure (ii) shows a diagram of the cube on which the same path has been drawn.  

Each edge of the network which joins a corner to a face centre has length, while each edge which joins two adjacent corners has length `1/sqrt(2)`.   

So the length of the path shown is `1 + 12 × 1/sqrt(2)`, that is `1 + 6sqrt(2)`. This is the length of the shortest path along the edges of the network which passes through all 14 vertices.  

To prove this, we first note that to connect the 14 vertices we need a minimum of 13 edges, so the length of the shortest path must be at least `13 × 1/sqrt(2)`.  

A path of this length would move alternately between corners and face centres, but as there are 8 corners and 6 face centres this is impossible. At least one of the edges on the shortest path, therefore, must join two corners. So the length of the shortest path must be at least `1 + 12 × 1/sqrt(2)`.  

The diagrams show that such a path does exist so we are able to conclude that is indeed the length of the shortest path.

Each exterior angle of a regular hexagon = 360° ÷ 6 = 60°, so when sides HB and IC are produced to meet at A, an equilateral triangle, ABC, is created.  

Let the sides of this triangle be of length x. As BC, DE and FG are all parallel, triangles ABC, ADE and AFG are all equilateral. So `DE = DA = p + x`; `FG = FA = q + p + x`.

The perimeter of trapezium `BCED = x + p + x + 2p = 2x + 3p`; the perimeter of trapezium `DEGF = (p + x) + (q + p + x) + 2q = 2x + 2p + 3q`; the perimeter of hexagon `FGIKJH = 2((q + p + x) + 2r) = 2x + 2p + 2q + 4r`.  

So `2x + 3p = 2x + 2p + 3q`; hence `p = 3q`. Also `2x + 2p + 3q = 2x + 2p + 2q + 4r`; hence `q = 4r`.  

So `p : q : r = 12r : 4r : r = 12 : 4 : 1`.
