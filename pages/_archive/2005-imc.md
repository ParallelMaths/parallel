__8.1__ What fraction of a 24-hour day does school take up, if school starts at 8:30am and finishes at 3:15pm?

* [x] `9/32`
* [ ] `25/96`
* [ ] `13/48`
* [ ] `31/96`
* [ ] `18/32`
{.col-5}

The required fraction `= 6 (3/4)/24 = 27/96 = 9/32`.

The area of triangle `A = 1/2 × 2 × 3 = 3`;  
The area of parallelogram `B = 1 × 3 = 3`;  
The area of triangle `C = 1/2 × 3 × 2 = 3`;  
The area of rectangle `E = 1 × 3 = 3`.  
However, the area of triangle `D = 3 × 3 − (3 + 3 + 1//2) = 2 1/2`.

__10.1__ Granny has taken up deep-sea fishing! Last week, she caught a fish so big that she had to cut it into three pieces (head, body and tail) in order to weigh it.  

The tail weighed 9kg and the head weighed the same as the tail plus one third of the body. The body weighed as much as the head and tail together.  

How much did the whole fish weigh?

* [ ] 18 kg
* [ ] 27 kg
* [x] 54 kg
* [ ] 77 kg
* [ ] 84 kg
{.col-5}

---

Let the weights in kg of the head and body of the fish be `h` and `b` respectively.  

Then and `h = 9 + 1/3b` and `b = h + 9`.  

So `b = 9 + 1/3 b + 9`, that is `2/3 b = 18`, which gives `b = 27`.  

Hence `h = 18`, so the whole fish weighed 54kg.

__16.1__ A 1 × 2 × 3 block is placed on an 8 × 8 board, as shown with the 1 × 2 face ‘X’ at the bottom.  

It is rolled over an edge without slipping onto the 1 × 3 face Y, then onto the 2 × 3 face Z, then onto X, Y, Z again in that order.  

How many different squares on the board has the block occupied altogether, including the starting and ending positions?

* [ ] 18
* [x] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 21
* [ ] 22

The two dark squares are those on which the block stands originally.  

After the first move, it occupies the squares labelled ‘1’ or ‘1/5’. After the second move it occupies the squares labelled ‘2’ and so on.  

After the fifth and final move, it occupies the squares labelled ‘5’ or ‘1/5’.  

As can be seen, 19 squares are occupied altogether.

__17.1__ Platinum is a very rare metal, even rarer than gold. Its density is 21.45 g/cm`^3`.  

Assuming that the world production has been about 110 tonnes for each of the past 50 years, and negligible before that, which of the following has a comparable volume to that of the total amount of platinum ever produced?


* [ ] a shoe box
* [ ] a cupboard
* [x] a house
* [ ] Buckingham Palace
* [ ] the Grand Canyon
{.col-5}

---

The volume of 1kg of platinum is (1000/21.45)cm`^3`, that is approximately 50cm`^3`.  

So 1 tonne of platinum has a volume of approximately 50,000cm`^3`, which is 1/20m`^3`.  

The volume of platinum produced per year is therefore about 5m3 and the total volume of platinum ever produced is approximately 250m`^3`.  

This is the volume of a cuboid measuring 10m × 5m × 5m, which is comparable to a house.

__18.1__ Three-quarters of the area of the rectangle has been shaded.  

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 2.4
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 3.6
* [x] 4

---

The area of the rectangle is 48 cm`^2`, so the unshaded area is 12 cm`^2`.  

Therefore 1/2 × x × 2 + 1/2 × (6 − x) × 8 = 12, that is x + 24 - 4x = 12, so x = 4.

## 20.

::: problem id=20_1 marks=5
__20.1__ One of the following is the largest of nine consecutive positive integers whose sum is a perfect square. Which one is it?

* [ ] 118
* [ ] 128
* [ ] 138
* [x] 148
* [ ] 158

---

The mean of the nine consecutive positive integers is the fifth of the numbers, so their sum is nine times the fifth number. As nine is itself a perfect square, the sum will be a perfect square if and only if the fifth number is a perfect square.  

For the options given, the fifth numbers are 114, 124, 134, 144 and 154 respectively.

::: problem id=22_1 marks=5
__22.1__ Inspector Remorse had a difficult year in 2004. A crime wave in Camford meant that he had 20% more cases to solve than in 2003, but his success rate dropped.  

In 2003, he solved 80% of his cases, but in 2004 he solved only 60% of them.  

What was the percentage change in the number of cases he solved in 2004 compared with 2003?

* [x] Down by 10%
* [ ] Down by 8%
* [ ] No change
* [ ] Up by 8%
* [ ] Up by 10%
{.col-5}

---

Let the number of cases solved in 2003 be `x`. Then, as this was 80% of the number of cases, there were `5x/4` cases to solve in 2003. So the number of cases to solve in 2004 was `5x/4 × 6/5`, which is `3x/2`.  

Inspector Remorse solved 60% of these cases, that is `3x/2 × 3/5`, which is `9x/10`.  

So the change in the number of cases solved was a 10% decrease.
