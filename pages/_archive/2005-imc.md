__18.1__ Three-quarters of the area of the rectangle has been shaded.  

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 2.4
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 3.6
* [x] 4

---

The area of the rectangle is 48 cm`^2`, so the unshaded area is 12 cm`^2`.  

Therefore 1/2 × x × 2 + 1/2 × (6 − x) × 8 = 12, that is x + 24 - 4x = 12, so x = 4.

__20.1__ One of the following is the largest of nine consecutive positive integers whose sum is a perfect square. Which one is it?

* [ ] 118
* [ ] 128
* [ ] 138
* [x] 148
* [ ] 158

---

The mean of the nine consecutive positive integers is the fifth of the numbers, so their sum is nine times the fifth number. As nine is itself a perfect square, the sum will be a perfect square if and only if the fifth number is a perfect square.  

For the options given, the fifth numbers are 114, 124, 134, 144 and 154 respectively.

__22.1__ Inspector Remorse had a difficult year in 2004. A crime wave in Camford meant that he had 20% more cases to solve than in 2003, but his success rate dropped.  

In 2003, he solved 80% of his cases, but in 2004 he solved only 60% of them.  

What was the percentage change in the number of cases he solved in 2004 compared with 2003?

* [x] Down by 10%
* [ ] Down by 8%
* [ ] No change
* [ ] Up by 8%
* [ ] Up by 10%

Let the number of cases solved in 2003 be `x`. Then, as this was 80% of the number of cases, there were `5x/4` cases to solve in 2003. So the number of cases to solve in 2004 was `5x/4 × 6/5`, which is `3x/2`.  

Inspector Remorse solved 60% of these cases, that is `3x/2 × 3/5`, which is `9x/10`.  

So the change in the number of cases solved was a 10% decrease.
