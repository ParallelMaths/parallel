# Year 8: Summer Problems #1

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

This is the first of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. 


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the value of 9002 – 2009?

* [ ] 9336
* [x] 6993
* [ ] 6339
* [ ] 3996
* [ ] 3669
{.col-5}

---
`9002 - 2002 = 7000` so `9002 - 2009 = 7000 - 7 = 6993`.

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
Which of the following points is not at a distance of 1 unit from the origin?

* [ ] (0, 1)
* [ ] (1, 0)
* [ ] (0, -1)
* [ ] (-1, 0)
* [x] (1, 1)
{.col-5}

---

Each of points (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1) and (-1, 0) is 1 unit from the origin, but the point (1, 1) is at a distance of √2 units from the origin.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
How many minutes are there from 11:11 until 23:23 on the same day?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 720
* [x] 732
* [ ] 1212
* [ ] 7212
{.col-5}

---

The time difference is 12 hours and 12 minutes, that is 732 minutes.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-1/4-angles-question.gif){image align="right"}
The diagram shows three squares of the same size. What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 105
* [x] 120
* [ ] 135
* [ ] 150
* [ ] 165

---

The triangle in the centre of the diagram is equilateral since each of its sides is equal in length to the side of one of the squares. The sum of the angles at a point is `360°`, so `x = 360 - (90 + 90 + 60) = 120`.
:::


## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
The sum of ten consecutive integers is 5. What is the largest of these integers?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] more information needed

---

Let the ten consecutive integers be `x - 4`, `x - 3`, `x - 2`, `x - 1`, `x`, `x + 1`,
`x + 2`, `x + 3`, `x + 4` and `x + 5` respectively.

The sum of these is `10x + 5` so `10x + 5 = 5`, that is `x = 0`.

Hence the largest of the integers is 5.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
The kettle in Keith’s kitchen is 80% full. After 20% of the water in it has been poured out, there are 1152 ml of water left. What volume of water does Keith’s kitchen kettle hold when it is full?

* [ ] 1400 ml
* [ ] 1600 ml
* [ ] 1700 ml
* [x] 1800 ml
* [ ] 2000 ml
{.col-5}

---
20% of the 80% is 16% of the kettle's capacity. Therefore the volume of water
left in the kettle after Keith has poured out 20% of the original amount is 64%
of the kettle's capacity. So when full, the kettle holds `1152/64 × 100` ml, that is
1800 ml.

The diagram on the right shows a rhombus `FGHI` and an isosceles triangle `FGJ` in which `GF = GJ`. Angle `FHI = 111°`.

What is the size of angle `JFI`?

* [x] 27°
* [ ] 29°
* [ ] 31°
* [ ] 33°
* [ ] 34.5°

---

Adjacent angles on a straight line add up to 180°, so `∠GJF = 180° - 111° = 69°`.

In triangle `FGJ`, `GJ = GF` so `∠GFJ = ∠GJF`. Therefore `∠FGJ = (180 − 2 × 69)° = 42°`.

As the shape `FGHI` is a rhombus, `FG = FI` and therefore `∠GIF = ∠FGJ = 42°`.

Finally, from triangle `FJI`, `∠JFI = (180 - 111 - 42)° = 27°`.

## 8.

Starting at the square containing the 2, you are allowed to move from one square to the next either across a common edge, or diagonally through a common corner.

How many different routes are there passing through exactly two squares containing a 0 and ending in one of the squares containing a 9?

* [ ] 7
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 15
* [x] 25
* [ ] 32
{.col-5}

In order to reach a 9 in three steps, the first zero must be one of the three adjacent to the 2 and the second zero must be one of the five adjacent to a 9.

The table shows the number of such routes to that point.

So the total number of different routes is 25.

## 9.

::: problem id=9_1 marks=3
In Miss Quaffley’s class, one third of the pupils bring a teddy bear to school. Last term, each boy took 12 books out of the library, each girl took 17 books and each teddy bear took 9 books.

In total, 305 books were taken out. How many girls are there in Miss Quaffley’s class?

* [ ] 4
* [x] 7
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 16
{.col-5}

---
Let the number of boys in Miss Quaffley's class be `b` and the number of girls be `g`. Then the number of teddy bears is `1/3 (b + g)`. Also, in total, the boys took out `12b` library books last term and the girls took out `17g` books. The total number of books taken out by the bears was `9 × 1/3 (b + g)` that is `3 (b + g)`.

So `12b + 17g + 3(b + g) = 305`, that is `15b + 20g = 305`, that is `3b + 4g = 61`.

Clearly, `b` and `g` are positive integers. The positive integer solutions of the
equation `3b + 4g = 61` are `b = 3`, `g = 13`; `b = 7`, `g = 10`; `b = 11`, `g = 7`; `b = 15`, `g = 4`; `b = 19`, `g = 1`.

However, there is one further condition: the number of teddy bears, that is `1/3 (b + g)`, is also a positive integer and of the five pairs of solutions above,
this condition is satisfied only by `b = 11`, `g = 7`.

Check: the 11 boys take out 132 books, the 7 girls take out 119 books and the 6 teddy bears take out 54 books, giving a total of 305 books.

_(The equation `3b + 4g = 61` in which `b` and `g` both represent positive integers is an example of a Diophantine equation.)_

And that’s the end of the first Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
