# Year 8: Summer Problems #2

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the second of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/1-die-question.gif){image align="right"}
How many of the six faces of a die have fewer than three lines of symmetry?

* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6

---
Each of faces 1, 4 and 5 has four axes of symmetry, whilst each of faces 2, 3 and 6 has two axes of symmetry only.

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
Which of the following numbers is divisible by 7?

* [ ] 111
* [ ] 1111
* [ ] 11111
* [x] 111111
* [ ] 1111111

---

The problem may be solved by dividing each of the alternatives in turn by 7,
but the prime factorisation of 1001, i.e. `1001 = 7 × 11 × 13`, leads to the
conclusion that 111 111, which is `111 × 1001`, is a multiple of 7.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/3-perimeter-question.gif){image align="right"}
The figure on the right shows an arrangement of ten square tiles.

Which labelled tile could be removed, but still leave the length of the perimeter unchanged?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [x] E
{.col-5}

---

Removing tile A or tile B or tile D has the effect of reducing the perimeter by a distance equal to twice the side of one tile, whilst removing tile C increases the perimeter by that same distance.

Removing tile E, however, leaves the length of the perimeter unchanged.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
In a sequence of numbers, each term after the first three terms is the sum of the previous three terms. The first three terms are -3, 0, 2. Which is the first term to exceed 100?

* [ ] 11th term
* [ ] 12th term
* [x] 13th term
* [ ] 14th term
* [ ] 15th term
{.col-5}

---

The first thirteen terms of the sequence are −3, 0, 2, −1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 9, 16, 30,
55, 101, ... .
:::


## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
Karen was given a mark of 72 for Mayhematics. Her average mark for Mayhematics and Mathemagics was 78. What was her mark for Mathemagics?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 75
* [ ] 78
* [ ] 82
* [x] 84
{.col-5}

---

The sum of Karen's two marks was `78 × 2`, that is 156. So her mark for Mathemagics was `156 - 72`, that is 84.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/6-tiles-question.gif){image align="right"}
The tiling pattern shown uses two sizes of square, with sides of length 1 and 4.

A very large number of these squares is used to tile an enormous floor in this pattern.

Which of the following is closest to the ratio of the number of grey tiles on the floor to the number of white tiles?

* [x] 1:1
* [ ] 4:3
* [ ] 3:2
* [ ] 2:1
* [ ] 4:1
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/6-tiles-answer.gif){image align="right"}
The tiling pattern may be considered to be a tessellation by the shape shown, so the required ratio is 1:1.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=2
![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/7-diagram-question.gif){image align="right"}
In the diagram on the right, the number in each box is obtained by adding the numbers in the two boxes immediately underneath.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 300
* [ ] 320
* [ ] 340
* [x] 360
* [ ] More information needed

---

![](/resources/2018summer-8-2/7-diagram-answer.gif){image align="right"}
Let the numbers in the boxes be as shown in the diagram.

Then `b = 90 - a`; `c = 12 + a`; `d = b + 78 = 168 - a`.

Also, `e = 90 + c = 102 + a`; `f = 90 + d = 258 − a`.

So `x = e + f = 102 + a + 258 - a = 360`.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
The currency used on the planet Zog consists of bank notes of a fixed size differing only in colour. Three green notes and eight blue notes are worth 46 zogs; eight green notes and three blue notes are worth 31 zogs.

How many zogs are two green notes and three blue notes worth?

* [ ] 13 zogs
* [ ] 16 zogs
* [x] 19 zogs
* [ ] 25 zogs
* [ ] 27 zogs
{.col-5}

---
Let the value of a green note and the value of a blue note be `g` zogs and `b` zogs respectively. Then `3g + 8b = 46` and `8g + 3b = 31`. Adding these two equations gives `11g + 11b = 77`, so `b + g = 7`.

Therefore `3g + 3b = 21`. Subtracting this equation from the original equations in turn gives `5b = 25` and `5g = 10` respectively. So `b = 5`, `g = 2` and `2g + 3b = 19`.

And that’s the end of the second Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
