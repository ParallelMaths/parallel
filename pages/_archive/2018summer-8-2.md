# Year 8: Summer Problems #2

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the second of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.

The tiling pattern shown uses two sizes of square, with sides of length 1 and 4.

A very large number of these squares is used to tile an enormous floor in this pattern.

Which of the following is closest to the ratio of the number of grey tiles on the floor to the number of white tiles?

* [x] 1:1
* [ ] 4:3
* [ ] 3:2
* [ ] 2:1
* [ ] 4:1
{.col-5}

The tiling pattern may be considered to be a tessellation by the shape shown, so the required ratio is 1:1.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
The currency used on the planet Zog consists of bank notes of a fixed size differing only in colour. Three green notes and eight blue notes are worth 46 zogs; eight green notes and three blue notes are worth 31 zogs.

How many zogs are two green notes and three blue notes worth?

* [ ] 13 zogs
* [ ] 16 zogs
* [x] 19 zogs
* [ ] 25 zogs
* [ ] 27 zogs
{.col-5}

Let the value of a green note and the value of a blue note be `g` zogs and `b` zogs respectively. Then `3g + 8b = 46` and `8g + 3b = 31`. Adding these two equations gives `11g + 11b = 77`, so `b + g = 7`.

Therefore `3g + 3b = 21`. Subtracting this equation from the original equations in turn gives `5b = 25` and `5g = 10` respectively. So `b = 5`, `g = 2` and `2g + 3b = 19`.

And that’s the end of the second Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
