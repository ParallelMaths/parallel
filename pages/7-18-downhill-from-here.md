## 1. Winter Olympics Puzzle (A)

Every four years, the world’s leading winter athletes – the skiers, skaters,
sledders and snowboarders – gather to compete for medals in the Winter Olympic
Games.

Of course, among the drama, bravery and triumph, there is plenty of room for
maths! So, while you’re cheering on your favourites, don’t miss the chance to
tackle these Winter Olympics maths puzzles.

The Jamaican bobsled team was one of the most famous feel-good stories of the
1988 Games in Calgary. Jamaica’s Caribbean climate is not the most helpful for
bobsledding, but the team borrowed equipment and asked for help. While the
four-man bob team was unplaced after crashing in qualifying, the two-man team
finished a creditable 30th out of 41. The movie _Cool Runnings_ is – very
loosely – based on their experience.

In the bobsled (or bobsleigh), teams of two or four pack into a streamlined
sled and slide down a twisting, icy course with steep, banked corners as fast
as they possibly can – often as fast as 75mph. It gets its name from early
competitors who realised they could go faster by bobbing back and forth inside
the sled!

The 2010 Winter Olympics at Whistler, Canada, took place on a track 1,450
metres long. Each team had four runs at the course, and the winners were the
team with the smallest total time.

__Feel free to use a calculator for these puzzles!__

__1.2__ __Silver medal puzzle:__ After their final heat,
Canada were in second place with total time of 3 minutes, 24.85 seconds –
but Germany, in third place, still had one run to go.

In the first three heats, Germany had a total time of 2 minutes, 33.48
seconds.

How quickly, in seconds, did the German team have to complete their final run
to win at least a share of the silver medal?

| seconds |
| <input type="text" solution="51.37"/> |

3:24.85 is 204.85 seconds; 2:33:48 is 153.48 seconds. The difference, and
target time, is 51.37 seconds. In fact, Germany’s final heat time was 51:36!

__1.3__ __Gold medal puzzle:__ The USA’s second heat time of 50.86 seconds was a track
record.

What was their average speed in metres per second? Remember, the track was
1,450 metres long

Can you convert that to miles per hour? (Note: there are 1,609.344 metres in a mile AND please give your answer to two decimal places.)

| m/s  | mph |
| <input type="text" solution="28.51"/> | <input type="text" solution="63.77"/> |

---

1,450m in 50.86s is 1450 ÷ 50.86 = 28.51m/s. In 3,600 seconds, they would travel
about 102,636 metres, so they’re moving at 102,636 metres per hour. Dividing
this by 1,609.344 gives 63.77mph.

## 2. Winter Olympics Puzzle (B)

The most famous ski jumper in history is not exactly famous for being good.
Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards, self-funded and short-sighted, famously finished in
last place in both the 70m and 90m events at Calgary, Canada in 1988, scoring
fewer than half as many points as his nearest competitor. However, these
scores are still the British records for ski-jumping! In 2016, a film of his
exploits, _Eddie The Eagle_, was released.

![](/resources/7-18-downhill-from-here/2-ski-jump.jpg){image align="center"}

In the ski jump, competitors ski down a huge ramp, reaching speeds of up to
60mph before jumping as far down the hill as they possibly can.

Each jump is awarded points based on two factors: the distance jumped, and the
jumper’s style.

Here is the recipe (we've simplified it a bit for this puzzle!):

* Take 60 metres away from the distance jumped (this could be a negative
number!)
* Double the result
* Add on the style score.

A group of judges awards up to 60 points for style – how well the jumper
flies and lands.

For example, to work out the score for a ski jumper who jumped 95 metres with
enough grace to pick up 40 style points, you would calculate:

95 – 60 =  35  
35 ×  2 =  70  
70 + 40 = 110  
{.text-center}  

...so the jump would be worth 110 points.

Similarly, a jumper who manages 80 metres with 25 style points would score 65
points altogether.

__2.1__ __Bronze medal puzzle:__ Albert the Albatross (of
Albania) jumps exactly 90 metres and scores a perfect 60 for style. How many

60 for distance, 60 for style = 120 altogether

points was she awarded?

She has 70 for distance, so she must have another 50 for style.

__2.3__ __Gold medal puzzle:__ Lemmy the Lemming (of Latvia) scores a total of zero,
including no style points at all. How far did he jump in metres?

<input type="text" solution="60"/>

To get 0 points for distance, Lemmy must have jumped exactly 60 metres.

## 3. The physics of ski jumping

To understand the underlying physics in the previous question, take a look at
this video that explains how to be a ski jump champion... and then answer this
question.

## 4. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2011 (14) --->

![](/resources/7-18-downhill-from-here/4-cuboid.png){image align="right"} The
diagram shows a cuboid in which the area of the shaded face is one-quarter of
the area of each of the two visible unshaded faces. The total surface area of
the cuboid is 72 cm².

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1__ What, in cm², is the area of one of the visible unshaded faces of the
cuboid?

* [x] 16
* [ ] 28.8
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 36
* [ ] 48
{.col-5}

---

Let the area of the shaded face be ⲭcm². Then each of the visible unshaded
faces has area 4ⲭcm². Hence the total surface area of the cuboid in cm² is
ⲭ + ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ + 4ⲭ = 18ⲭ (because there are two ends, each of area ⲭ, and four sides, each of area 4ⲭ).

So 18ⲭ = 72. Therefore ⲭ = 4, and the area of one of the visible unshaded faces,
in cm² is 4ⲭ =  16.

## 5. The affine cipher

Over the last couple of weeks, we discussed how you can encode a message by
turning each letter into a number according to the alphabet-number pairings
below, and either (1) adding a fixed value to each letter-number or (2)
multiplying each letter-number by a fixed value. The result is then turned
back into a letter.  

| 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
{.grid}

| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
{.grid}

The affine cipher uses both multiplication and addition to encipher a letter,
word or whole message. For example, let’s multiply each letter in the message
(L<sub>M</sub>) by 5 and then add 2 to get each letter in the code (L<sub>C</sub>). We could say:

L<sub>C</sub> = (5 × L<sub>M</sub>) + 2{.text-center}  

Let’s apply this affine cipher to the word CAB. If we turn this into numbers,
we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.  

If we multiply by 5 and add 2, we obtain 12 ¦ 2 ¦ 7.  

__If we translate back into letters, the code is MCH.__

Now, let’s encipher the same word, but this time we will change the affine
cipher so that we multiply by 9 and add 11:

L<sub>C</sub> = (9 × L<sub>M</sub>) + 11{.text-center}  

Again we will start with the word CAB. If we turn this into numbers, we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.  

If we multiply by 9 and add 11, we obtain 29 ¦ 11 ¦ 20.  

Remember, we cannot have numbers bigger than 25, so we subtract 26 from any
problematic numbers, so that 29 becomes 3. So, the new letter sequence is 3 ¦
11 ¦ 20.  

__If we translate back into letters, the code is DLU.__  

If you are confused (perhaps you missed some of the earlier Parallelograms),
then take a look at this video from [Chris at Chegg.com](http://www.chegg.com){target="_blank"}. The explanation is
fairly slow and lengthy, but it should clear up any confusion.

Now that you have mastered the affine cipher, answer these questions.
