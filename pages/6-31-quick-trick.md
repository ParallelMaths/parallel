*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Speedy sums

How quickly can you add up ten numbers?  

Watch this video where James Grime shows us a quick number trick that will have you adding at the speed of light and putting calculators to shame.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ After your volunteer has generated their ten numbers, how do you find the sum?

* [ ] Add the numbers column by column  
* [ ] Add the two biggest numbers  
* [x] Multiply the 4th from last number by 11  
* [ ] Multiply the 4th number by 10

__1.2__ The maths behind this trick is based on a famous sequence where you add the previous two terms to get the next term.  

What was the name of the sequence?  

* [ ] The golden ratio
* [x] Fibonacci sequence
* [ ] The Mersenne primes
* [ ] Triangular numbers

__1.3__ James described a lightning speed method for multiplying by 11.  

Use that method to calculate 251 × 11.  

<input type="number" solution="2761"/>

To quickly multiply a 3 digit number by 11 we know the first and last digits will stay the same:  
2__1  

To find the second digit, we add the first two digits together, in this case 2 + 5:  
27_1  

To find the third digit, we add the last two digits together, 5 + 1:  
2761

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ There is a quick way to check if numbers are divisible by 11:  

- Alternate between subtracting and adding the digits  
- If the result is in the 11 times table then the number is divisible by 11.

Which of the following is NOT divisible by 11?  

* [ ] 2,442
* [ ] 21,648
* [ ] 123,321
* [x] 11,111
{.col-4}

## 2. Some tricky puzzles

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ The sum of the first 5 odd positive numbers is 25.  

What is the sum of the first 5 even positive numbers?  

* [x] 30
* [ ] 35
* [ ] 40
* [ ] 45
* [ ] 50
{.col-5}

---

You could work this out by simple addition, but there is a quicker way:  
 
As each even number is 1 more than the previous odd number, if the sum of the first five odd numbers is 25, the sum of the first five even numbers must be 25 + 5 = 30.

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ Mr Fussy wants to buy a new house, but he does not want a house with the digit 4 in the door number!  

The new houses are numbered 1 to 100.  

How many houses can Mr Fussy choose from?  

* [x] 19
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 80
* [ ] 81
* [ ] 90
{.col-5}

There are 10 numbers starting with 4.  

There are 9 more numbes containing a 4 (i.e., 4, 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94).  

For a total of 19.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
