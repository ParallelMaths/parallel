It’s nearly Christmas. Not very many people realise that the original name for this holiday was Chrismaths. For centuries, children traditionally completed mathematics problems during the festive period. The amount of effort that children put into their mathematics problems allowed Santa to decide who had been naughty and who had been nice.

With this in mind, this week’s Parallelogram contains a WHOLE maths challenge paper – 25 glorious questions to stretch your brain over Chrismaths.

The time limit on maths challenges is 60 minutes, but it might take you up to 90 minutes to complete all the questions. However, you can tackle the challeges in one, two or three or more sessions. Just complete all the questions and hit the submit button before you go back to school in January. Bear in mind, the last 10 questions are tough. Also, in the real maths challenge paper, there is negative marking for tough questions, which means you lose marks for incorrect answers – don’t worry, in this Parallelogram you will not lose marks for wrong answers.

As this Parallelogram is longer than a typical Parallelogram, you can win a maximum of 400 (rather than 100) rewards points – this is a real opportunity to win an extra badge (or two).

Good luck and happy Chrismaths. Don’t eat too many mince pie charts!

Simon.

You are told that 30 pupils have 25 different birthdays between them.  

What is the largest number of pupils who could share the same birthday?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
{.col-5}

---

There must be 25 pupils who all have different birthdays. If the remaining pupils all have the same birthday as one of these pupils, then 6 pupils will share the same birthday.

Four of these numbers can make two pairs so that each pair adds up to 98,765.  

Which number is the odd one out?

* [ ] 37,373
* [ ] 45,678
* [ ] 53,087
* [ ] 61,392
* [x] 70,082
{.col-3}

---

37,373 + 61,392 = 98,765, and 45,678 + 53,087 = 98,765, so 70,082 is the odd one out.

{.col-5}

---

The angles marked `a°`, `c°` and `e°` may be considered to be the exterior angles of the triangle, and therefore have a total of 360°. As `b° = a°`, `d° = c°` and `f° = e°` (all pairs of vertically opposite angles), `b° + d° + f° = 360°`. So `a° + b° + c° + d° + e° + f° = 720°`.

The sum of two numbers is 2. The difference between them is 4. What is their product?

* [ ] -8
* [x] -3
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

Let the numbers be `x` and `y`. Then `x + y = 2`; `x - y = 4`. Adding these equations gives `2x = 6`, so `x = 3`. Hence `y = 2 - 3 = -1` so the numbers are 3 and -1.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=4
In Niatirb they use Cibara numerals. These are the same shape as normal Arabic numerals, but with the meanings in the opposite order. So "0" means "nine", "1" means "eight" and so on.  

But they write their numbers from left to right and use arithmetic symbols just as we do. So, for example, they use 62 for the number we write as 37.  

How do the inhabitants of Niatirb write the answer to the sum which they write as 837 + 742?

* [ ] 419
* [x] 580
* [ ] 1579
* [ ] 5317
* [ ] 8420
{.col-5}

---

The sum is what we would write as 162 + 257 and this equals 419. However, in Niatirb it would be written 580.

Which of the following straight lines cuts the shaded area in half?

* [ ] XA

* [ ] XE
{.col-5}

---

The shaded area is a trapezium of area `1/2 (3 + 7) × 5 = 25`.  

Line XD forms one side of a trapezium of area 12.5, since `1/2 (1 + 4) × 5 = 12.5`.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=4
In March 2003, Welshman Tony Evans dropped a ball from an aircraft a mile above the Mojave desert to see if it would bounce. The ball was made from 6 million rubber bands, had a circumference of 14ft 8in, weighed 2600 pounds and took Mr Evans five years to build.  

On average, roughly how many rubber bands did he add each day while building the ball?

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 33
* [ ] 330
* [x] 3300
* [ ] 33,000
{.col-5}

---

The average number of rubber bands added each day was approximately `6000000/(5 × 365) ≈ 6000000/1800 ≈ 3300`

The surface areas of the cuboids are: A 68; B 70; C 56; D 52; E 76.

What is the mean of `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4` and `1/6`?

* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/15`
* [ ] `5/12`
* [ ] `7/24`
* [x] `5/16`
{.col-5}

---

The four fractions total `5/4`, so their mean is `5/4 ÷ 4 = 5/16`.

## 11.

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/11-board.png){image align="right"}
The diagram shows a square board in which strips of white squares alternate with strips of black and white squares.  A larger board, constructed in the same way, has 49 black squares.

How many white squares are there on the larger board?

* [x] 176
* [ ] 196
* [ ] 245
* [ ] 289
* [ ] 392
{.col-5}

---

The 49 black squares will be in a 7 × 7 formation, so the board will measure 15 × 15 squares. Hence the number of white squares = 225 - 49 = 176.

Four of these points lie on a single straight line. Which is the odd one out?

* [ ] (−3, −3)
* [ ] (−2, −1)
* [x] (2, 5)
* [ ] (4, 11)
* [ ] (5, 13)
{.col-5}

---

Points (−3, −3), (−2, −1), (4, 11) and (5, 13) all lie on the line whose equation is `y = 2x + 3`, but (2, 5) does not lie on this line.
:::


## 14.

::: problem id=14_1 marks=4
![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/14-sum.png){image align="right"}
In this addition sum, each letter represents a different non-zero digit.  

What is the value of `a + w + a + y`?

* [ ] 13
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17
* [ ] 18
{.col-5}

---

We note first that `y` = 5 is the only non-zero digit which, when it is multiplied by 3, has itself as the units digit. So there is a carry of 1 into the tens column. We note also that a = 1 or a = 2 as “`fly`” < 1000 and therefore 3 × “`fly`” < 3000.  

We now need 3 × `l` + 1 to end in either 1 or 2 and the only possibility is `l` = 7, giving `a` = 2 with a carry of 2 into the hundreds column.  

As `a` = 2, `f` must be at least 6. However, if `f` = 6 then `w` = 0 which is not allowed. Also the letters represent different digits, so `f` ≠ 7 and we can also deduce that `f` ≠ 9 since `f` = 9 would make `w` = 9.

Hence `f` = 8, making `w` = 6 and the letters represent 875 × 3 = 2625.

## 15.

::: problem id=15_1 marks=4
Only one of these triangles can actually be made.

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/15-triangles.png){image align="center"}

Which is it?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [x] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

As triangle A has two equal sides, it should have two equal angles, but its angles are 25°, 110° and 45° so it is impossible to make.  

In a triangle, the smallest angle lies opposite the shortest side which makes B impossible since 20° is the smallest angle, but 5 cm is not the shortest side.  

Triangle C is impossible as `4^2 + 7^2 ≠ 8^2`, so it does not obey Pythagoras' Theorem.  

The longest side of a triangle must be shorter than the sum of the other two sides, but this is not the case in triangle E, so it cannot be made either.  

Triangle D, however, is obtained by cutting an equilateral triangle of side 6cm in half along an axis of symmetry and so can certainly be made.
:::


## 16.

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/16-pattern.png){image align="right"}
If the pattern shown is continued, what number will appear directly below 400?

* [ ] 438
* [ ] 439
* [x] 440
* [ ] 441
* [ ] 442

---

Note that the number at the end of the `n`th row is `n^2`, so 400 will lie at the end of the 20th row.  

The row below will end in `21^2`, ie 441, so the number directly below 400 will be 440.
:::


## 17.

::: problem id=17_1 marks=4
A, B, C, D, E, P and Q are points on the number line as shown.

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/17-numberline.png){image align="center"}

One of the points represents the product of the numbers presented by P and Q. Which is it?

* [ ] A
* [x] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

As P and Q both lie between 0 and 1, their product will be greater than 0 but smaller than P and smaller than Q. Of the options available, only B satisfies these conditions.  

Furthermore, its position is correct since `P` is approximately equal to `1/2`, which means that the product of P and Q lies approximately halfway between 0 and Q.

In the triangle `PQR`, there is a right angle at `Q` and angle `QPR` is 60°.  

The bisector of the angle `QPR` meets `QR` and `S`, as shown.

What is the ratio of `QS` : `SR`?

* [ ] 1 : 1
* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(2)`
* [ ] 1 : (3 - `sqrt(3)`)
* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(3)`
* [x] 1 : 2
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/18-triangle-answer.png){image align="right"}
Angle PRS = 30°, so triangle PRS is isosceles with SP = SR.  

Hence `(QS)/(SR) = (QS)/(SP) = 1/2` as `PQS` is half of an equilateral triangle.

Alternatively, we can use the angle bisector theorem: `(QS)/(SR) = (PQ)/(PR) = 1/2`as `PQR` is also half of an equilateral triangle.

## 19.

::: problem id=19_1 marks=4
Three rectangular-shaped holes have been drilled passing all the way through a solid 3 x 4 x 5 cuboid. The diagrams show the front, side and top views of the resulting block.

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/19-rectangles.png){image align="center"}

What fraction of the original cuboid remains?

* [ ] `13/30`
* [ ] `7/15`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `8/15`
* [ ] `17/30`
{.col-5}

---

Consider the cuboid to be made up of 60 unit cubes. The front and side views show that top and bottom layers consist of the same number of cubes and from the top view we see that this number is 14. The front and side views indicate that only the 4 corner cubes remain in the middle layer, so the total number of cubes remaining is 2 × 14 + 4 = 32. The required fraction, therefore, is `32/60 = 8/15`.
:::


## 20.

::: problem id=20_1 marks=4
What is the largest power of 2 that divides `127^2 - 1`?

* [ ] `2^1`
* [ ] `2^7`
* [x] `2^8`
* [ ] `2^63`
* [ ] `2^127`
{.col-5}

---

Using the formula for the difference of two squares:  

`127^2 − 1 = 127^2 − 1^2 = (127 + 1)(127 − 1) = 128 × 126 = 2^7 × 2 × 63 = 2^8 × 3^2 × 7`.

A square is divided into four congruent rectangles and a smaller square, as shown. The diagram is not to scale.  

The area of the small square is `1/4` of the area of the whole square.  

What is the ratio of the length of a short side of one of the rectangles to the length of a long side?

* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(2)`
* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(3)`
* [ ] 1 : 2
* [x] 1 : 3
* [ ] 1 : 4
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/21-square-answer.png){image align="right"}  
Let the length of a short side of a rectangle be `x` and the length of a long side be `y`. Then the whole square has side of length `(y + x)`, whilst the small square has side of length `(y - x)`.  

As the area of the whole square is four times the area of the small square, the length of the side of the whole square is twice the length of the side of the small square.  

Therefore `y + x = 2(y − x)` i.e. `y = 3x` so `x : y = 1 : 3`.
:::


## 22.

::: problem id=22_1 marks=5
In a maths exam with `N` questions, you score `m` marks for a correct answer to each of the first `q` questions, and `m + 2` marks for a correct answer to each of the remaining questions.  

What is the maximum possible score?

* [x] `(m + 2)N - 2q`
* [ ] `Nm`
* [ ] `mp + (m + 2)q`
* [ ] `N(m + 1)`
* [ ] `Nm + q(m + 2)`
{.col-5}

---

If you answer all questions correctly, you receive `m` marks for each of the `N` questions plus an extra 2 marks for the last `(N − q)` questions.  

So the maximum possible score `= m × N + 2 × (N − q) = mN + 2N − 2q = (m + 2)N − 2q`.

In the diagram, the letter `S` is made from two arcs, `KL` and `MN`, which are each five-eights of the circumference of a circle of radius 1, and the line segment `LM`, which is tangent to both circles.  

At points `K` and `N`, common tangents to the circles touch one of the circles.  

What is the length `LM`?

* [ ] `3/2`
* [ ] `3 - sqrt(2)`
* [x] `2`
* [ ] `(3 sqrt(2))/2`
* [ ] `1 + sqrt(2)`
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/10-13-chrismaths/23-shape-answer.png){image align="right"}  
Let the centres of the circles be `J` and `O` and let `NI` be the common tangent shown.  

Let `P` be the point of intersection of `JO` and `LM`.  

As arc `KL` is 5/8 of the circumference of the top circle, `∠IJL` = 45°.  

Consider quadrilateral `IJON`: sides `IJ` and `NO` and are radii, so they are both of unit length and they are
both perpendicular to tangent `NI`. So `IJON` is a rectangle.  

Hence `∠IJO = 90°` and `∠LJP = 90° − 45° = 45°`. In triangle `JLP`, `∠JPL = 180° − (90° + 45°) = 45°`.  

So triangle `JLP` is isosceles and `LP = LJ =` 1 unit.

By a similar argument, it may be shown that `PM` is also of length 1 unit, so `LM = LP + PM =` 2 units.

## 24.

::: problem id=24_1 marks=5
If `p`, `q` and `p - q` are all positive integers, which of the following is least?

* [x] `(q^2)/(p^2)`
* [ ] `(p^2)/(q^2)`
* [ ] `q/p`
* [ ] `sqrt(q/p)`
* [ ] `sqrt(p/q)`
{.col-5}

---

We may deduce that `p > q`, so, as `p` and `q` are both positive, `(p^2)/(q^2)` > `sqrt(p)/sqrt(q)` > 1.  

We may also deduce that 0 < `(q^2)/(p^2)` < `q/p` < `sqrt(q)/sqrt(p)` < 1.

Hence `(q^2)/(p^2)` is the least of the five numbers.

Triangles `ABG`, `GFE` and `EFA` are similar, so `AF : FE = EF : FG = GB : BA = 1 : 2`.  

Thus if `AF = a`, then `FE = 2a`, `FG = 4a`, and the shaded area is `8a^2`.  

By Pythagoras' Theorem, `AE = sqrt(5)a`, so `AD = 2 sqrt(5)a` and the area of the square is `20a^2`.  

Thus the required fraction is `8/20`, which is `2/5`.

Alternatively, as we have shown that `FG = 4AF`, we can divide parallelogram `AGCE` into 10 congruent triangles, 8 of which make up rectangle `EFGH`.  

So the area of the rectangle is `4/5` of the area of the parallelogram, which in turn is half the area of square `ABCD`.
