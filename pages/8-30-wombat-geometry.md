::: problem id=1_1 marks=5
__1.1__ Which of the following has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself?
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 19
* [x] 25
{.col-5}

---

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6; the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8; the factors of 13 are 1 and 13; the factors of 19 are 1 and 19; and the factors of 25 are 1, 5 and 25. We see from this that, of the numbers we are given as options, only 25 has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself. It is worth noticing that 25 is the only square number.

__2.1__ Yes, you did just watch a wombat farting. If the wombat went on to do a poo, what shape would its poo be?

* [ ] Sphere
* [x] Cube
* [ ] Cylinder
* [ ] Klein bottle
* [ ] Stellated rhombic dodecahedron

Wombat poo is roughly cubic, and the [BBC explains](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46258616) why this is the case.

__3.1__ The figure on the right shows an arrangement of ten square tiles.

Which labelled tile could be removed, but still leave the length of the perimeter unchanged?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [x] E
{.col-5}

---

Removing tile A or tile B or tile D has the effect of reducing the perimeter by a distance equal to twice the side of one tile, whilst removing tile C increases the perimeter by that same distance.

Removing tile E, however, leaves the length of the perimeter unchanged.

## 4. Wombats in art

Dante Gabriel Rossetti attended King’s College School in London, where he developed a passion for art.  

After he became a world famous painter, he developed an interest in exotic pets, and in 1869 he acquired his first pet wombat.  

We might have veered away from our main topic of mathematics, but that happens sometimes.  

The world is an extraordinary place and it is good learn about everything.  

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ Like all marsupials, a wombat female has a pouch. Where is the opening to the pouch?    

* [ ] At the top of the pouch, nearer the wombat’s front legs.
* [x] At the bottom of the pouch, nearer the wombat’s back legs.

---

Unlike kangaroos, wombats have their pouches upside-down, with the opening at the bottom, nearer to their back legs.  

This is because wombats dig with their front legs, and having the pouch opening at the bottom avoids soil been thrown into the pouch.  

Koalas are close relatives of wombats, and they also the opening to the pouch at the bottom.  

This sounds risky, because koalas spend their time upright, high in trees, but the opening to the pouch is probably quite tight, so there is no risk of the baby koala falling out.

__5.1__ In the multiplication grid on the right, the input factors (in the first row and the first column) are all missing and only some of the products within the table have been given.

What is the value of A + B + C + D + E ?

* [ ] 132
* [ ] 145
* [x] 161
* [ ] 178
* [ ] 193

![](/resources/8-30-wombat-geometry/13-grid-answer1.jpg){image align="right"}
Let the input factors be `p, q, r, s` and `t` along the top row, and `v, w, x, y` and `z` in the first column, as shown in the grid on the right.

We see that `wp = 15` and `xp = 18`, so that `p` is a divisor of both 15 and 18, and hence is either 1 or 3. However, if `p = 1`, then it would follow that `w = 15`. But this is not possible as `wr = 40`. We deduce that `p = 3`. It follows that `w = 5` and `x = 6`. Since `w = 5` and `wr = 40`, we have that `r = 8`.

Therefore, as `zr = 56`, `z = 7`. Also, as `x = 6` and `xs = 60`, `s = 10`. ![](/resources/8-30-wombat-geometry/13-grid-answer2.jpg){image align="right"} Since `vs = 20`, it follows that `v = 2`. Then, as `vq = 10`, `q = 5`. Hence, as `yq = 20`, we have that `y = 4` . Finally, as `yt = 24`, we deduce that `t = 6`.

This enables us to complete the table, as shown on the left. (Though, really, we need only to calculate the diagonal entries that we have shown in bold.)

Therefore, we have `A + B + C + D + E = 6 + 25 + 48 + 40 + 42 = 161`.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=6
__6.1__ In rectangle `PQRS`, the ratio of `∠PSQ` to `∠PQS` is 1:5 . What is the size of `∠QSR`?

* [ ] 15°
* [ ] 18°
* [ ] 45°
* [ ] 72°
* [x] 75°
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/8-30-wombat-geometry/18-rectangles-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
Let `∠QSR` `= x°`. Since `PS` is parallel to `QR`, the alternate angles `∠PQS` and `∠QSR` are equal. So `∠PQS` `= x°`. Therefore, as `∠PSQ`:`∠PQS` `= 1:5`, `∠PSQ` `= 1/5 x°`. Therefore, from the right angled triangle `PQS` we deduce that `x + 1/5 x + 90 = 180` and so `6/5 x = 90`. Therefore `x = 5/6 × 90 = 75`.

So `∠QSR` is 75°.

__7.1__ Sam wants to complete the diagram so that each of the nine circles contains one of the digits from 1 to 9 inclusive and each contains a different digit.  

Also, the digits in each of the three lines of four circles must have the same total.  

What is this total?

* [ ] 17
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 19
* [x] 20
* [ ] 21
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/8-30-wombat-geometry/23-circles-answer1.png){image align="right"}
We suppose that `x`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are the numbers in the circles, as shown in the diagram. These numbers are the digits 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.

Let the common total of the digits in the three lines be `k`.

Then: `(x + a + b + 5) + (x + e + f + 2) + (5 + c + d + 2) = 3k`,  

that is, `(x + a + b + c + d + e + f ) + x + 14 = 3k`.  

Now `x + a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 38`  

and therefore  

`52 + x = 3k`.  

![](/resources/8-30-wombat-geometry/23-circles-answer2.png){image align="right"}
It follows that `52 + x` is divisible by 3. Now `x` is one of 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the only one of these possible values for which 52 + `x` is divisible by 3 is `x` = 8. This gives 52 + `x` = 60.  

Hence `60 = 3k`, and so `k = 20`.   

In the context of the JMC, we can stop here. But to give a full mathematical solution we should satisfy ourselves that it is possible to place the digits in the circles so that each line adds up to 20.  

One way this can be done is shown in the diagram opposite.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
