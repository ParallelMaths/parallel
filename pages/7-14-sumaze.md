# _Year 7 • Parallelogram 14_ Sumaze

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

There are only 2 more Parallelograms this year, as we will be starting our summer break at half-term. If you score highly enough in the last 4 Parallelograms (#12, #13, this one & #15) by June 1, __then you will receive a Parallel certificate__. An average of more than 40% in these four Parallelograms wins a bronze certificate, then 60% or more wins silver and 80% or more wins gold.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
* Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
* Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Hidden Figures – another maths movie

![](/resources/sumaze/hidden-figures-poster.png){width=170}

Last week we looked at the film “Good Will Hunting” and explored one of the
mathematical problems that appears in it. I also posed a question about another
film: “What is the title of the film that celebrates the role of the pioneering
women mathematicians at NASA in the 1960s?”  

Most of you correctly identified the film as Hidden Figures. Let’s start by
watching the trailer.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Just to check that you were concentrating on that trailer, for how many
hours did the children say their mother had been gone?

* [ ] 3 hours
* [ ] 30 hours
* [x] 300 hours
* [ ] 3,000 hours
* [ ] 30,000 hours

---
The answer is 300 hours, which the mother immediately converts into 12½ days.
:::

The film tells the story of three brilliant black women who helped send the
American astronauts into space. These are just a few of the many women who
played a crucial role in the space race. It is a terrific film, which received
three Oscar nominations and which is both inspiring and exciting. Well worth
watching if your parents or teacher can get hold of the DVD.

## 2. Moore's Law

The women were known as “computers”, because the original term computer
referred to a person who did calculations. Only later did the term computer
become more associated with machines. Increasingly, machine computers at NASA
took over from human computers, and many of the women became some of the first
computer programmers and operators. Those early computers were incredibly
difficult to operate and relatively slow, certainly compared to today’s
computers, as discussed in a blogpost on the ZME Science website:

_…back on Earth at the Goddard Space Flight Center thousands of flight
technicians and computer experts employed the IBM System/360 Model 75s
mainframe computer to make independent computations and maintain communication
between Earth and lunar landers. These computers cost $3.5 million a piece and
were the size of a car. Each could perform several hundred thousand addition
operations per second, and their total memory capacity was in the megabyte
range. Programs were developed for the 75s that monitored the spacecraft’s
environmental data and astronauts’ health, which were at the time the most
complex software ever developed. Today, however, even a simple USB stick or
WiFi router is more powerful, let alone an iPhone. The iPhone 6 uses an
Apple-designed 64 bit Cortex A8 ARM architecture composed of approximately 1.6
billion transistors. It operates at 1.4 GHZ and can process instructions at a
rate of approximately 1.2 instructions every cycle in each of its 2 cores.
That’s 3.36 billion instructions per second. Put simply, the iPhone 6’s clock
is 32,600 times faster than the best Apollo era computers and could perform
instructions 120,000,000 times faster. You wouldn’t be wrong in saying an
iPhone could be used to guide 120,000,000 Apollo era spacecraft to the moon,
all at the same time._

Transistors are important components of computer circuitry, and the more transistors a computer circuit has, the more calculations it can do at one time.

This remarkable improvement in computing is known as Moore’s Law. Wikipedia
says:

_Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense
integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is
named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel,
whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components
per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for
at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he
revised the forecast to doubling every two years_

You might not find this doubling of the number of transistors on a computer
circuit particularly impressive, but it is actually mind-blowing. It has
literally changed civilisation.  

When something doubles, and doubles again, and again and again … then the
results are phenomenal. It is a type of increase known as exponential growth.
The graph below shows Moore’s Law between 1971 and 2011. Take note of the funny
scale on the y-axis, which increases by a factor of 10 at each step. So, in 40
years, the number of transistors on a microprocessor increased from 2,300 to
2,600,000,000, which is an increase by a factor of more than a million.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
__2.1__ Look at the number of transistors on the 80486 microprocessor (~1990)
and the number of transistors on the AMD K8 microprocessor (~2002). By what
factor did the number of transistors increase in just 12 years?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 50
* [x] 100
* [ ] 500

---
The 80486 had roughly 1,000,00 transistors, and the AMD K8 had about 100,000,000
transistors, so there was an increase by a factor of 100.

## 3. The Chess Problem

There is a very old story that demonstrates the power of exponential growth and
Moore’s Law, but it relates to chess and rice, not computers and transistors.

In India, or Persia or somewhere east of the English Channel, the King or
Maharajah or Sultan wanted to reward a mathematician, because he had just
invented chess. The King offered a chest of gold coins or a barrel of diamonds,
but instead the mathematician asked for a grain of rice on the first square of a
chessboard, 2 grains on the second square, 4 grains on the third square and so
on, doubling the number of grains of rice on each square until the 64th square.

The King laughed at what seem like a trivial reward, but he did not laugh for
long.

Grab a piece of paper and work out the number of grains of rice on each of the
first 32 squares. You will almost certainly need a calculator, and make sure you
check your answers. I have given you a headstart by listing the answers for the
first 10 squares.

![](/resources/7-14-sumaze/rice-count-table.png)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
__3.1__ How many grains were on the 15th square?

<input type="text" solution="16,384"/>  

---
If the tenth square has 512 grains (from the table), then you should have
worked out (11th = 1,024), (12th, 2,048), (13th, 4,096), (14th, 8,192) and
(15th, 16,384). The answer is 16,384.
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ How many grains were on the 20th square?

<input type="text" solution="524,288"/>  

---
The answer is 524,288.
:::

::: problem id=3_3 marks=1
__3.3.__ How many grains were on the 32nd square?  

<input type="text" solution="2,147,483,648"/>  

---
The answer is 2,147,483,648.

You may have worked out that the number of grains on the `n`<sup>th</sup> square is `2n - 1`. So, instead of doubling over and over again, you could use the `x`<sup>`y`</sup> button on your calculator.
:::

If you carried on the calculation for the full 64 squares, then you should
arrive at 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains on the 64th square.

If you want to add up all the grains on all the squares, then the total is double
the number of grains on the final square minus 1. (You can check this by looking
at the table above. The total number of grains for the first, say, five squares
is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31, which is the same as \[2 × 16\] – 1 = 31.)  

This means that the total number of grains on all 64 squares is:
(2 × 9,223,372,036,854,775,808) – 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

That is about 100 billion tonnes of rice, which is about hundred times more rice
than the whole Earth grows each year. That is the power of exponential growth.

::: problem id=3_4 marks=2
__3.4__ In another version of the story, the King gets revenge by saying that
the mathematician can only have the grains of rice if he can count them. If the
mathematician counts at the rate of 1 grain per second, how long will it take
him to collect his reward of 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains? Which of these
answers is closest?

* [ ] 400 years
* [ ] 500 million years
* [x] 600 billion years
* [ ] 700 trillion years
* [ ] 800 quadrillion years

---
To count 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains will take 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
seconds, which is roughly 18 × 1018 sec = 3 × 1017 mins = 5 × 1015 hours = 2.1 ×
1014 days = 5.8 × 1011 years = 580 billion years, so the answer is roughly 600
billion years.

## 4. Summer salaries

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ You get a summer job that lasts for 6 weeks. You have two salary options:  

Option A – £100/week.  
Option B – a salary that doubles each week, starting at £10/week.  

How much would each option deliver in total after 6 weeks?

<input type="text" solution="600" placeholder="Option A Total"/>  
<input type="text" solution="630" placeholder="Option B Total"/>

---
Obviously option A delivers 6 x £100 = £600.

Option B delivers £10 + £20 + £40 + £80 + £160 + £320 = £630.

So option B is preferable.

## 5. Sumaze! Part 1

Sumaze! is a terrific new game that tests your core maths skills.

You will have access to 9 levels of the game, starting with some really trivial
ones to allow you to understand the game, followed by some trickier levels. You
score 1 point for level 1, 2 points for level 2, 3 points for level 3 and so on
until 9 points for level 9.

However, you will lose 2 points for every hint you use (available on levels 8 & 9). And if you have to restart a
level then you will lose 1 point each time, up to a maximum of 4 lost points. So, if you need one hint on level 9,
then your maximum score goes from 9 down to 7. And if you succeed after restarting three times,
then your score drops from 7 down to 4.

It is easier to understand Sumaze! by experiencing it, but in case it helps here are a few important rules and tips:

* Aim – to move your blue box to reach the “end of level” square.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number bigger than 1,000.
* Your box cannot at any time contain a number that is a fraction.
* You sometimes need keys to open doors to reach the “end of level” square.
* Passing through an arrow means you cannot go back.
* To pass through a green square you must satisfy the square’s condition.
* Pink squares (and their operations) disappear when you move onto them.
* Lilac squares (and their operations) can be crossed over and over again.
* IMPORTANT – Sumaze won't run on a smartphone. If you are currently on a smartphone,
  then type this into your PC/Mac/tablet browser: bit.ly/parallel_sumaze

You can stop and start Sumaze!, and the website will use cookies to remember your level and score so far,
but it is better to finish all the levels once you have started.

[Open Sumaze](https://integralmaths.org/games/parallel_sumaze_4/){.external target="_blank"}

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4.5
**5.1** When you have finished Sumaze, you will receive a score and a code word.
Please enter your code word here, so that we can add your Sumaze score to your
overall Parallelogram total.

<p class="text-center"><input v-model="c.answers.p_3" class="correct sumaze" placeholder="Sumaze Code Word"/></p>

Score: {{c.sumaze(c.answers.p_3)}} / 45 {.sumaze-score v-show="c.answers.p_3"}

*The maximum score in Sumaze is 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 9 = 45. We will divide your
Sumaze score by 10 and add it to your overall Parallelogram score. So
ultimately a perfect Sumaze score will add 45/10 = 4.5 to your Parallelogram
total score.*

## 6. Junior Maths Challenge question

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1__ The positive integers from 1 to 150 inclusive are placed in a 10 by 15
grid so that each cell contains exactly one integer. Then the multiples of 3 are
given a red mark, the multiples of 5 are given a blue mark, and the multiples of
7 are given a green mark. How many cells have more than 1 mark?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
* [x] 19

---
The squares that receive more than one mark are those which contain integers
which are divisible by at least two of the integers 3, 5 and 7. The integers 3
and 5 are coprime, that is, they have no common factor other than 1. Therefore
the integers that are divisible by 3 and 5 are precisely those that are
divisible by 3 × 5, that is, by 15. Every 15th integer is divisible by 15. Hence
the number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by
15 is (`150 ÷ 15`) which is 10.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 3 and 7 are precisely those that
are divisible by `3 × 7 = 21`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 21 is 7, because 21 divides into 150 only 7 (and a bit) times.

Similarly, the integers that are divisible by 5 and 7 are precisely those that are divisible by `5 × 7 = 35`. The number of integers in the range from 1 to 150 that are divisible by 35 is 4, because 35 divides into 150 only 4 (and a bit) times.

So it seems that we have `10 + 7 + 4` (or 21) numbers that will have multiple marks because they have multiple divisors.

However, you need to check for numbers that are divisible by 3, 5 and 7, because they would have been counted three times, not just once – when you look for numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, then 3 and 7, then 5 and 7. In fact, the only number less than 150 divisible by 3, 5 and 7 is 105, so you only need to remove 2 from your tally, i.e., the answer is `10 + 7 + 4 – 2 = 19`.
