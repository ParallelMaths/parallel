::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ My train was scheduled to leave at 17:40 and to arrive at 18:20. However, it started five
minutes late and the journey then took 42 minutes. At what time did I arrive?

* [ ] 18:21
* [ ] 18:23
* [ ] 18:25
* [x] 18:27
* [ ] 18:29
{.col-5}

The train arrived 5 + 42 = 47 minutes after 17:40, that is at 18:27.

__2.1.__  A station clock shows each digit by illuminating up to seven bars in a display. For example, the displays for 1, 6, 4 and 9 are shown.

When all the digits from 0 to 9 are shown in turn, which bar is used least?

The number of times each bar is used is: A 4; B 6; C 8; D 7; E 7.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__ Which of the following numbers is three less than a multiple of 5 and three more than a
multiple of 6?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 17
* [ ] 21
* [ ] 22
* [x] 27
{.col-5}

---

Of the options given, only 27, which is three less than a multiple of 5,
namely 30, and three more than a multiple of 6, namely 24, has both of the
properties in the question.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
![](/resources/7-45-trains-clocks/12-triangle-question.gif){image align="right"}
__4.1.__ The equilateral triangle `XYZ` is fixed in position. Two of the four small triangles are to be painted black and the other two are to be painted white. In how many different ways can this be done?


* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] More than 6

---

If the top triangle is painted black, then any one of the three remaining triangles may also be painted black. Similarly, if the top triangle is painted white, then any one of the three remaining triangles may also be painted white. So there are __six__ different ways.

## 5.
<!--- 2007 (13) --->
::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Points `P` and `Q` have coordinates (1, 4) and (1, −2) respectively. For which of the following
possible coordinates of point `R` would triangle `PQR` __not__ be isosceles?

* [ ] (−5, 4)
* [ ] (7, 1)
* [ ] (−6, 1)
* [x] (−6, −2)
* [ ] (7, −2)
{.col-5}

---

If `R` is (−5, 4) then `PQ = PR = 6`.  

If `R` is (7, 1) or if `R` is (−6, 1) then `R` lies on the perpendicular bisector of `PQ` (the line `Y = 1`), so in both cases `PR = QR`.  

If `R` is (7, −2), then `QP = QR = 6`.

However if `R` is (−6, −2), then `PQ = 6`, `QR = 7` and `PR > 7`, so triangle `PQR` is scalene.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
