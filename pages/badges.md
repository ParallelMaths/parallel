# Badges

In the Parallel Universe, you can earn awards by collecting points.

This page shows the points you have earned by completing Parallelograms. You earn 1 point for every percentage point you score in every Parallelogram. Points turn into badges. 

At the end of the academic year, you will be awarded a certificate based on the points you have scored.

You can also earn points and awards by attending our live Parallel Circles.

You can find out more on your main [Awards](/awards) page, which also explains the different awards and how you can earn them.
