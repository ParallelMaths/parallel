This is the fourth of our special Summer parallelograms.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=5
Which of these calculations produces a multiple of 5?

* [ ] `1 × 2 + 3 + 4`
* [ ] `1 + 2 × 3 + 4`
* [ ] `1 × 2 + 3 × 4`
* [x] `1 + 2 × 3 × 4`
* [ ] `1 × 2 × 3 × 4`

---
The results of the five calculations are 9, 11, 14, 25, 24 respectively.

## 2.

![](/resources/2018summer-4/2-triangle-question.gif){image align="right"}
In this diagram, what is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 16
* [ ] 36
* [x] 64
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 144

---

The unmarked interior angle on the right of the triangle `= (360 - 324)° = 36°`. So, by the exterior angle theorem, `x = 100 - 36 = 64`.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=5
King Harry's arm is twice as long as his forearm, which is twice as long as his hand, which
is twice as long as his middle finger, which is twice as long as his thumb. His new bed is as
long as four arms.

How many thumbs length is that?

* [ ] 16
* [ ] 32
* [x] 64
* [ ] 128
* [ ] 256
{.col-5}

---

n terms of length, 1 arm = 2 forearms = 4 hands = 8 middle fingers = 16 thumbs.

So 4 arms have the same total length as 64 thumbs.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
The faces of a cube are painted so that any two faces which have an edge in common are
painted different colours. What is the smallest number of colours required?

* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---

Consider one corner of the cube. There are three faces which meet there, and each pair of them has an edge in common. So three different colours are needed. No other colours will be needed provided that opposite faces are painted in the same colour since opposite faces have no edges in common.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
![](/resources/2018summer-4/5-rectangle-question.gif){image align="right"}
A rectangle `PQRS` is cut into two pieces along `PX`, where `PX = XR` and `PS = SX` as shown.

The two pieces are reassembled without turning either piece over, by matching two edges of equal length. Not counting the original rectangle, how many different shapes are possible?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

New shapes may be formed by joining `PX` to `XR` (quadrilateral) or `SP` to `RQ` (parallelogram) or `XS` to `RQ` (trapezium).

Triangle `SPX` shows that `PX` and `SX` have different lengths; and `PX` and `PQ` have different lengths because `XR` is shorter than `SR`.

So there are no other places to position the triangle.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=6
The figures below are all drawn to scale. Which figure would result from repeatedly following the following instructions:

__Move forward 2 units.  
Turn right.  
Move forward 15 units.  
Turn right.  
Move forward 20 units.  
Turn right.__  

* [x] A ![](/resources/2018summer-4/6-shape-1.gif)
* [ ] B ![](/resources/2018summer-4/6-shape-2.gif)
* [ ] C ![](/resources/2018summer-4/6-shape-3.gif)
* [ ] D ![](/resources/2018summer-4/6-shape-4.gif)
* [ ] E ![](/resources/2018summer-4/6-shape-5.gif)

---
Of the five alternatives, only A and B have straight lines in the ratio 2:15:20.

However, B would be formed by repeatedly moving forward 2 units, turning right, moving forward 20 units, turning right, moving forward 15 units, turning right.

Therefore the correct answer is A.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=6
![](/resources/2018summer-4/7-diagram-question.gif){image align="right"}
In the diagram on the right, `PT = QT = TS`, `QS = SR`, `∠PQT = 20°`.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 20
* [ ] 25
* [ ] 30
* [x] 35
* [ ] 40

---

![](/resources/2018summer-4/7-diagram-answer.gif){image align="right"}
As `QS = SR`. `∠SRQ = ∠SQR = x°`.

So `∠QST = 2x°` (exterior angle theorem). Also `∠TQS = 2x°` since `QT = TS`.

As `PT = QT`, `∠TPQ = ∠TQP = 20°`.

Consider the interior angles of triangle `PQR`: `20 + (20 + 2x + x) + x = 180`.

So `4x + 40 = 180`, hence `x = 35`.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=6
![](/resources/2018summer-4/8-clock-question.gif){image align="right"}
On a digital clock displaying hours, minutes and seconds, how many times in each 24-hour period do all six digits change simultaneously?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 24
{.col-5}

---
The only such occasions occur when the clock changes from `09 59 59` to `10 00 00`; from `19 59 59` to `20 00 00` and from `23 59 59` to `00 00 00`.

## 9.

::: problem id=9_1 marks=6
![](/resources/2018summer-4/9-square-question.gif){image align="right"}
A large square is divided into adjacent pairs of smaller squares with integer sides, as shown in the diagram (which is not drawn to scale). Each size of smaller square occurs only twice.

The shaded square has sides of length 10. What is the area of the large square?

* [ ] 1024
* [ ] 1089
* [ ] 1156
* [x] 1296
* [ ] 1444

---
Let the lengths of the sides of the squares, in increasing order, be `a,b, c, d, e, f , g, h, i` respectively. So `h = 10`.

Note that `c = 2b - a` and `d = 2c - 2a = 4b - 4a`. Also, `e = 2d - a = 8b - 9a`.

As `h = 2e - 2a - b = 15b - 20a`, we may deduce that `15b - 20a = 10`, that is `3b - 4a = 2`.

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers less than 10, the only possibilities are `a = 1`, `b = 2` or `a = 4`, `b = 6`. However, `h = 10` therefore `b` cannot be greater than 4. So `a = 1` and `b = 2`.

It may now be deduced that `c = 4 - 1 = 3`; `d = 8 - 4 = 4`; `e = 16 - 9 = 7`. Also `2g = 2e + d`, so `g = 9`.

Now the length of the side of the larger square is `2h + e + g = 20 + 7 + 9 = 36`, so its area is 36<sup>2</sup> = 1296.

_(Note that it was not necessary to find the values of f and i, but it is now quite simple to deduce that `f = 8` and `i = 18`.)_
