__Parallel__ is weekly set of maths challenges for students aged 11 to 13, written by [Dr Simon Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh), author of the No. 1 bestseller [Fermat’s Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_(book)) and [The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_and_Their_Mathematical_Secrets). Every parallelogram contains 60 minutes of interesting, fun and challenging material that goes beyond school maths: mystery and history, activities and oddities, puzzles and problems.

The project was devised as an add-on for the [Top-Top Set Project](/about#top-top-set) and is supported by the [Good Thinking Society](/about#good-thinking). All the materials are __completely free__.
