# Web Developer Support Role

Parallel (https:/parallel.org.uk) is seeking an enthusiastic senior web developer who is excited to direct their skills towards our mission of increasing the number and diversity of excellent young mathematicians.

Founded by bestselling science writer Simon Singh MBE, Parallel is a charitable initiative that runs multiple programmes that support bright and keen students (aged 10-16, mainly in the UK) to develop their mathematical curiosity and problem solving skills beyond the curriculum. This includes:  

* __Parallelogram:__ a collection of ‘puzzle sheets’, released weekly for each year group and automatically marked. 
* __Parallel Circles:__ live, interactive webinars that can reach thousands of students at a time.
* __Parallel Academy:__ a set of multi-year programmes established in 2023 that sets students up for long-term success in maths. The Tutorial Programme has rapidly grown in the past two years to support 600 students, with ambitions to double this number each year. More than two thousand students in the Academy have been placed on various webinar-based programmes.  

All of these initiatives are managed through our proprietary online platform, which has distinct user experiences for students, school teachers, tutors and project administrators. Most of the functionality relates to the Academy, for which the platform serves as a bespoke and ever evolving learning management system. It is central to all manner of logistics such as scheduling and real-time reporting, as well as the administration of homework, tests and other learning resources.  

Remarkably, the Parallel platform has been developed and maintained by a single volunteer developer. As we look to expand the project to reach many thousands more students each year, we are now looking for additional support to help maintain the platform, attend to daily issues and support with new feature development.  

## Key Technologies & Tools

The Parallel platform is built with the following technologies:  

* __Frontend:__ React, Typescript  
* __Backend:__ Node.js, GraphQL (AWS Appsync)  
* __Infrastructure:__ AWS (Lambda, AppSync, Dynamodb), Firebase  

Experience with all of these technologies is desired but not critical. You will be joining a very small team however, so the ability to work, troubleshoot, & learn independently is crucial.  

We expect that this role will require 20 hours per month, with some variation from one week to the next. Our success to date has relied upon the rapid responsiveness of our lead developer and, working under his supervision, we require the same from this role.
