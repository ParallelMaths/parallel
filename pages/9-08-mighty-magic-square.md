The number 3 is prime, but the other numbers listed are not prime:

* 33 = 3 × 11
* 333 = 3 × 111
* 3333 = 3 × 1111.

Triangle `QRS` is isosceles and right-angled.  

Beatrice reflects the P-shape in the side `QR` to get an image.  

She reflects the first image in the side `QS` to get a second image.  

Finally, she reflects the second image in the side `RS` to get a third image.  

What does the third image look like?

In the diagram, `PQRS` is a parallelogram; `∠QRS = 50°`; `∠SPT = 62°` and `PQ = PT`.

![](/resources/9-08-mighty-magic-square/11-parallelogram.jpg){image align="center"}

What is the size of `∠TQR`?

* [ ] A) 84°
* [ ] B) 90°
* [x] C) 96°
* [ ] D) 112°
* [ ] E) 124°

Because `PQRS` is a parallelogram, `∠SPQ = ∠QRS = 50°`. Therefore `∠TPQ = (62 + 50)° = 112°`.  

Therefore, as the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, `∠PQT + ∠PTQ = 180° - 1120 = 68°`.

Because `PQ = PT`, the triangle `QPT` is isosceles, and so `∠PQT = ∠PTQ`. Therefore `∠PQT = ∠PTQ = 34°`.  

Because `PQRS` is a parallelogram, `∠PQR + ∠QRS = 180°`, and therefore `∠PQR = 180° - 50° = 130°`.  

Therefore, `∠TQR = ∠PQR - ∠PQT = 130° - 34° = 96°`.

The diagram shows a large equilateral triangle divided by three straight lines into seven regions.

The three grey regions are equilateral triangles with sides of length 5 cm and the central black region is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2 cm.  

What is the side length of the original large triangle?

* [ ] A) 18 cm
* [x] B) 19 cm
* [ ] C) 20 cm
* [ ] D) 21 cm
* [ ] E) 22 cm

Let `P, Q, R, S, T, U` and `V` be the points shown. All the angles in all the triangles are 60°. So `∠QRT = ∠PSU` and hence `RT` is parallel to `SU`.  

Similarly, as `∠RSV = ∠TUV`, `RS` is parallel to `TU`. Therefore `RSUT` is a parallelogram.  

Therefore `RS` has the same length as `TU`, namely, 2 + 5 = 7 cm. Similarly `PQ` has length 7 cm.

So the length of `PS` which is the sum of the lengths of `PQ`, `QS` and `RS` is 7 + 5 + 7 = 19 cm.

The parallelogram PQRS is formed by joining together four equilateral triangles of side 1 unit, as shown.  

What is the length of the diagonal SQ?

* [x] A) `sqrt(7)`
* [ ] B) `sqrt(8)`
* [ ] C) `3`
* [ ] D) `sqrt(6)`
* [ ] E) `sqrt(5)`

Let `T` be the foot of the perpendicular from `Q` to the line `SR` extended. Now `RQT` is half of an equilateral triangle with side length 1. Hence the length of `RT` is 1/2 and hence `ST` has length `1 + 1 + 1/2 = 5/2`.

By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the right angled triangle `RQT, (1)^2 = (1/2)^2 + QT^2`.

Therefore `QT^2 = (1)^2 - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`

Hence, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the right angled triangle `SQT, SQ^2 = ST^2 + QT^2 = (5/2)^2 + 3/4 = 25/4 + 3/4 = 7`.

Therefore, `SQ = sqrt(7)`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
