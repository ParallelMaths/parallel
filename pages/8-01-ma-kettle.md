__Origin__: late 16th century: from French parallélogramme, via late Latin from Greek parallēlogrammon, from parallēlos ‘alongside another’ + grammē ‘line’.  

1. a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.
2. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
   mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
   young mathematicians.

</div>

Welcome to the first of out Parallelograms designed for Year 8 students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons more squiggly.

You can start and stop whenever you like, but you should complete all the challenges by 7pm on Sunday, particularly if your teacher has asked to complete this Parallelogram.

You can return to the site any time after 7pm on Sunday and you will find your score and a sheet with answers and explanations… as long as you have completed the challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in six parts… some Challenges will have a single theme, while others have sections that shoot off in wildly different directions. In short, these challenges are often going to be a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas.

__IMPORTANT__ – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct answer).

__IMPORTANT__ – some questions have a hint (sometimes two hints). Please think hard and try hard before resorting to the hint. The hints will help you get the right answer, but you will lose marks.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Einstein’s pi

Watch this clip from _Night at the Museum 2 (Battle of the Smithsonian)_ and listen carefully to the references to π.

@[youtube](l3DXVVSRYdE?start=22)

Although Einstein has no problem remembering the digits of π, most of the rest of us find it tricky. 3.14 is about as good as many of us can manage.

As you might know, the digits of π go on forever, so you will never memorise all of π, but there are tricks called _mnemonics_ (pronounced __NEM__-__ON__-__ICK__) that can help you remember quite a few digits.

For example, take the phrase:

_“How I wish I could calculate pi.”_

If you count the number of letters in each word, then you obtain the digits 3.141592.

_“Can I have a small container of coffee?” leads to 3.1415926._

Alternatively, you can remember π with the fraction 22/7.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ How accurate is 22/7 compared to the true value of π?

* [x] 0.04%
* [ ] 0.1%
* [ ] 2%
* [ ] 3%
* [ ] 4.2%

---

22/7 = 3.14286  
π    = 3.14159

Inaccuracy is (22/7 – π ) / π = 0.00127 / 3.14159 = 0.0004 	= 0.04%
:::

An even better approximation is 355/113 (which is easy to remember because you just have to remember to repeat the first three odd numbers and then split the result in the middle (113355).

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2.__ How accurate is 355/113 compared to the true value of π?

* [ ] 0.0000000008%
* [ ] 0.00000008%
* [x] 0.000008%
* [ ] 0.0008%
* [ ] 0.08%

:::

Because π cannot be written as a fraction with perfect fraction it is labelled an irrational number, but it is not the only irrational number. The golden ratio, often represented as φ (pronounced phi), is the number 1.61803398874...

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3.__ How accurate is 13/8 compared to the true value of φ?

* [ ] 0.1%

* [ ] 0.8%

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (4)

The world's largest coin, made by the Royal Mint of Canada, was auctioned in June 2010. The coin has mass 100 kg, whereas a standard British £1 coin has mass 10g.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ What sum of money in £1 coins would weigh the same as the record-breaking coin?

* [ ] £100
* [ ] £1,000
* [x] £10,000
* [ ] £100,000
* [ ] £1,000,000
{.col-5}

---

We have to work out how many £1 coins, each weighing 10 g, we need to get a total weight of 100kg. Now 1kg = 1000g, and so 100kg = 100,000g. So we need 100,000/10 = 10,000 of these coins. That is, £10,000 in money.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (5)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__  All old Mother Hubbard had in her cupboard was a Giant Bear chocolate bar. She gave each of her children one-twelfth of the chocolate bar. One third of the bar was left. How many children did she have?

* [ ] 6
* [x] 8
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 18
{.col-5}

---

One third of the bar was left, so Mother Hubbard’s children ate two-thirds of the bar. Since they ate one-twelfth of the bar each, Mother Hubbard had (2/3)/(1/12) = (2/3)x(12/1) = 24/3 = 8 children.

## 4. Harmonic Pendulum

Take a look at this video of a collection of pendula (the plural of pendulum), which behave in a beautiful and surprising way. It’s called a wave pendulum or harmonic pendulum. It lasts three minutes, and it is worth watching right through to the end to see the amazing effect.

@[youtube](RrX2yTGJ6N0?rel=0)

Tom Rowett, who was in the video, has a huge and wonderful collection of odd objects, and we will meet more of them in later Parallelograms. In this case, each pendulum swings at a different rate, because it has a different length. In fact, there is a formula that determines the relationship between the length of the pendulum and time it takes to swing from left to right and back to the left.

`T = 2π√(L/g)`

where
* __T__ is the time of a complete swing in seconds.
* __π__ is 3.14 (Wow! Always nice to see π.)
* __L__ is the length of the pendulum in meters.
* __g__ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²). Don’t worry about this – it is a bit of physics that describes how an object falls due to the Earth’s gravity.

If __L__ = 2 meters:  
__T__ = 2 x 3.14 x √(2/9.8) = 6.28 x √(0.204) = 6.28 x 0.4517  
__T__ = 2.837 seconds.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ If one of the pendula in the video is 0.15 meters long, how long is the period of the swing?

* [ ] 0.10 seconds
* [ ] 0.15 seconds
* [ ] 0.39 seconds
* [x] 0.78 seconds
* [ ] 1.00 second
:::

::: problem id=4_2 marks=3
__4.2__ If you wanted a pendulum to have a swing time of 1 second (__T__ = 1 second), how long should the pendulum be? At the moment the equation gives you the time (__T__) depending on the length (__L__), so it might be useful to rearrange the equation so that you have the length depend on the time.

* [ ] 0.0018 metres
* [x] 0.18 metres
* [ ] 0.99 metres
* [ ] 1.16 metres
* [ ] 1.8 metres

^^^ hint id=1 marks=2
`T = 2π√(L/g)`  
So,	 `T/2π = √(L/g) `  
So,	`(T/2π)^2 = L/g `  
So,	`g.(T/2π)^2 = L `
^^^

---

We know that:

  `g.(T/2π)^2 = L`	or	`L = g.(T/2π)^2`

We want to know L for a T of 1 second, so:

  `L= g.(T/2π)^2`  
  `L= 9.8 x (1/2π)^2`  
  `L = 9.8 x 0.043^2`  
  `L = 0.18 meters`

## 5. Ma and Pa Kettle

Ma and Pa Kettle were hillbilly characters in an American TV fow in the 1940s. The characters featured in nine films, which grossed $35 milllion, which was a huge amount of money back then. In fact, without Ma and Pa Kettle, Universal Studios would have gone bankrupt, and with Universal there would be no Jurassic Park, no Despicable Me, no Jaws, no Fast and Furious franchise.
In this clip, Ma and Pa Kettle wrestle with some maths. See you can understand how and why they think 25/5 = 14.

__5.1__ Using the mistaken approach Ma and Pa Kettle, what is 3 x 16? You might need to watch video again.

## 6. Pi mnemonic song

Andrew Huang has created a song which is a mnemonic for the first 100 decimal places of π. It is quite charming, apart from occasional mentions of ZERO. There must be a better way to deal with zero, rather than just saying zero, e.g., pick one letter and any word that starts with that letter, regardless of its length represents zero.

Anyway, see what you make of it, and maybe make up your own mnemonic for π.

I hope you enjoyed (or at least did not hate) this Parallelogram, the first one of the 2018. There will be more next week, and the week after, and the week after that. So check your email or return to the website on Friday.

In the meantime, you can find the answers and go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday. This is really important. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something knew.

First... Remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, so that we can mark your answers.

Also, once you have hit the SUBMIT button there will an extra bit of optional Parallelogram if you are feeling particularly keen.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Additional Stuff

This video shows a young lad called Benjamin Most reciting from memory 2,422 digits of π. I should stress that memorising numbers has nothing to do with being good at mathematics, but you have to admire his determination to memorise so many digits.

@[youtube](VvNbW5ZoI_k)

And Benjamin has a long way to go to beat the world record for memorising π, which stands at 70,030 digits.

Here is [one of my favourite cartoons about π](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2208){target="_blank"} – see if you can understand the joke. If not, ask your teacher to explain it.

And [here is a short article about the history and significance of π.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-pi-and-how-did-it/){target="_blank"}
