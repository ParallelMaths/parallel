# Amazing Grace

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* It’s half-term for most of you, so this Parallelogram is a bit longer and you have a bit more time to complete it. Importantly, double badge points!
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. History of Mathematics

As mentioned last week, the terrific Mathigon website has loads of great material, including a timeline showing the great mathematicians of past centuries. Visit the [timeline](https://mathigon.org/timeline){target="_blank"} (click and it will open up in a new tab) and answer the three questions below. __Just enter the name given in the plum box__.

So, if the answer is John Napier, just enter __Napier__, because that is the name that appears in the plum-coloured box on the timeline:

__2.1__ The diagram shows an equilateral triangle, a square, and one diagonal of the square.  

What is the value of `x`?

Let `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` be the vertices of the square, and `A`, `D` and `E` be the vertices of the equilateral triangle, as shown.  

`∠EDA = 60°` because it is the angle of an equilateral triangle.  

`∠ADC = 90°` because it is the angle of a square. The diagonal `DB` bisects the angle `ADC`, and therefore `∠ADB = 45°`.  

It follows that `x° = ∠EDA + ∠ADB = 60° + 45° = 105°`.  

Therefore `x = 105`.

<!--- 2009 (14) --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__ Karen was given a mark of 72 for Mayhematics. Her average mark for Mayhematics and Mathemagics was 78. What was her mark for Mathemagics?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 75
* [ ] 78
* [ ] 82
* [x] 84
{.col-5}

---

The sum of Karen's two marks was `78 × 2`, that is 156. So her mark for Mathemagics was `156 - 72`, that is 84.

## 4. The Amazing Grace

Grace Hopper was a force of nature. A rear admiral in the American Navy, a pioneer in computing and a terrific mathematician. Find out more below and answer the question that follows.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ What is the sum of the digits in the completed crossnumber?

![](/resources/8-30-amazing-grace/5-crossnumber.png){image align="center"}

^^^ hint id=5_1
Which power of 11 has 5 digits? Try `11^4`.
^^^

* [x] 25
* [ ] 29
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 34
* [ ] 35
{.col-5}

The answer to __3 Across__ is a 5-digit power of 11. We have `11^2 `= 121, `11^3` = 1331, `11^4` = 14641.

Any higher power of 11 has more than 5 digits. We deduce that __3 Across__ is 14641.  

It follows that __2 Down__ is a 2-digit square with units digit 4. Hence __2 Down__ is 64.  

We now see that __1 Across__ is a 3-digit cube with units digit 6. The only such 3-digit cube is 216 (= `6^3`).

![](/resources/8-30-amazing-grace/5-crossnumber-answer.png){image align="right"}
Hence the completed crossnumber is as shown in the figure.

We see that the sum of the digits in the completed crossnumber is:  

2 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 25.

## 6. Even more amazing Grace

Here is an interview between Grace Hopper (question 4) and Dave Letterman (who is a legendary chat show host). Take a look and answer the questions below.  

As you might have guessed, Grace Hopper is one of my heroes.

## 7. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2017 (25) --->

::: problem id=7_1 marks=5
__7.1__ The distance between Exeter and London is 175 miles. Sam left Exeter at 10:00 on Tuesday for London. Morgan left London for Exeter at 13:00 the same day. They travelled on the same road. Up to the time when they met, Sam’s average speed was 25 miles per hour, and Morgan’s average speed was 35 miles an hour.

At what time did Sam and Morgan meet?

* [ ] 17:00
* [ ] 15:55
* [ ] 15:30
* [ ] 15:00
* [x] 14:40
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=7_1
Because the answer to this question depends only on the average speeds of Sam and Morgan up to the time when they meet, we may assume that Sam’s average speed was 25 miles an hour from 10:00 to 13:00 and also from 13:00 up to the time when they meet. If follows that by 13:00 Sam has gone 75 miles and is therefore at that time 100 miles away from London.

If follows that by 13:00 Sam has gone 75 miles and is therefore at that time 100 miles away from London.

As soon as Morgan sets off they are approaching each other at a combined average speed of 25 + 35 miles an hour, that is, at 60 miles an hour. Therefore it takes a further `100/60` hours until they meet. Because:

`100/60` hours = 1 `40/60` hours = 1 hour and 40 minutes,  

it follows that they meet 1 hour and 40 minutes after 13:00. Hence they meet at 14:40.

## 8. OK Go

OK Go is an American rock band, famous for their quirky one-take music videos. This one shows an elaborate machine that employs all sorts of mechanics. Watch and enjoy … and look out for the answers to these two questions.

__8.1__ In the last minute of the video, there is an interesting version of Newton’s cradle. Normally a series of suspended metal ball bearings swing to and fro, with the one on the left passing its momentum to the right, via the ones in the middle... and then vice versa. What is OK Go’s cradle made from?

* [ ] Water balloons
* [x] Sledge hammers
* [ ] Baseball bats
* [ ] Koala bears

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
* The next Parallelogram will be out next Thursday at 3pm.

Cheerio,
Simon.
