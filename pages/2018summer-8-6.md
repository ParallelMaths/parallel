This is the final of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. The answer sheet (with explanations) will appear as soon as you hit the submit button.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
Which of the following could have a length of 2010 mm?

* [x] A table
* [ ] An oil tanker
* [ ] A teaspoon
* [ ] A school hall
* [ ] A hen's egg
{.col-5}

---

2010 mm = 2.01 m so, of the alternatives given, only a table could be expected to have a length of 2010 mm.

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
Which of the following has the largest value?

* [ ] A: `6 ÷ 1/2`
* [ ] B: `5 ÷ 1/3`
* [x] C: `4 ÷ 1/4`
* [ ] D: `3 ÷ 1/5`
* [ ] E: `2 ÷ 1/6`
{.col-5}

---

The values of the expressions are A 12; B 15; C 16; D 15 and E 12.
:::


## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
Which of the following is the longest period of time?

* [x] `3002` hours
* [ ] `125` days
* [ ] `17 1/2` weeks
* [ ] `4` months
* [ ] `1/3` of a year

---

One year is, at most, 366 days, so one-third of a year is less than 125 days.

No month is longer than 31 days, so 4 months is also less than 125 days, as is 17.5 weeks which equals 122.5 days.

However 3002 hours equals 125 days 2 hours, so this is the longest of the five periods of time.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Sir Lance has a lot of tables and chairs in his house. Each rectangular table seats eight people and each round table seats five people.

What is the smallest number of tables he will need to use to seat 35 guests and himself, without any of the seating around these tables remaining unoccupied?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

There are 36 people to be seated so at least five tables will be required. The number of circular tables must be even.

However, five rectangular tables will seat 40 people and three rectangular and two circular will seat 34. So at least six tables are needed.

Two rectangular and four circular tables do seat 36 people: so six is the minimum number of tables.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-6/5-rectagle-question.gif){image align="right"}
A 6 by 8 and a 7 by 9 rectangle overlap with one corner coinciding as shown.

What is the area (in square units) of the region outside the overlap?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 21
* [x] 27
* [ ] 42
* [ ] 69

---

The two shaded regions measure 3 by 7 and 1 by 6, so the total area outside the overlap is 27 units<sup>2</sup>.
:::


## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
Sam's 101st birthday is tomorrow. So Sam's age in years changes from a square number (100) to a prime number (101).

How many times has this happened before in Sam's lifetime?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

The other times that this has happened previously are when Sam's age in years went from 1 to 2; from 4 to 5; from 16 to 17 and from 36 to 37.

_Note that since primes other than 2 are odd, the only squares which need to be checked, other than 1, are of even numbers._

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
![](/resources/2018summer-8-6/7-hexagons-question.gif){image align="right"}
A shape consisting of a number of regular hexagons is made by continuing to the right the pattern shown in the diagram, with each extra hexagon sharing one side with the preceding one.

Each hexagon has a side length of 1 cm.

How many hexagons are required for the perimeter of the whole shape to have length 2010 cm?

* [ ] 335
* [ ] 402
* [x] 502
* [ ] 670
* [ ] 1005
{.col-5}

---

The first and last hexagons both contribute 5 cm to the perimeter of the pattern. Every other hexagon in the pattern contributes 4 cm to the perimeter.

The first and last thus contribute 10 cm, so we need another 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 hexagons. Therefore the total number of hexagons required is 502.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
The year 2010 belongs to a special sequence of twenty-five consecutive years: each number from 1988 to 2012 contains a repeated digit.

Each of the following belongs to a sequence of consecutive years, where each number in the sequence contains at least one repeated digit.

Which of them belongs to the next such sequence of at least twenty year

* [ ] 2099
* [x] 2120
* [ ] 2199
* [ ] 2989
* [ ] 3299
{.col-5}

---

In the 21st Century, to obtain a sequence of two years or more then either a 2 or a 0 must be repeated in each year, or the sequence include years such as 2011, 2033, 2044 etc.

So the only sequence after that mentioned in the question will be from 2020 to 2030, but this is too short.

In the 22nd Century, either a 2 or a 1 must be repeated. The first such sequence is 2110 to 2129 which does include 20 years, one of which is 2120.
