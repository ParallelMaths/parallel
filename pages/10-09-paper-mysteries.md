<!--- (2017) Q1 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ What is the value of `2/5 + 2/50 + 2/500`?

* [ ] 0.111
* [ ] 0.222
* [ ] 0.333
* [x] 0.444
* [ ] 0.555
{.col-5}

We have 2/5 = 0.4. Multiplying by 1/10 is the same as dividing by 10, and therefore has the effect of moving the decimal point one place to the left. Therefore `2/50 = 1/10 × 2/5 = 0.04` and `2/500 = 1/10 × 2/50 = 0.004`. Hence `2/5 + 2/50 + 2/500 = 0.4 + 0.04 + 0.004 = 0.444`.

<!--- (2016) Q18 --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ The sum of the areas of the squares on the sides of a right-angled isosceles triangle is 72 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

What is the area of the triangle?

* [ ] 8 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 9 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 12 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 18 cm<sup>2</sup>

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=2
Let the equal sides of the right-angled isosceles triangle have length `x` cm.

![](/resources/10-09-paper-mysteries/4-triangle-answer.jpg){image align="center"}

Then the squares on these sides have area `x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the area of the square on the hypotenuse of the triangle is `(x^2 + x^2)` cm<sup>2</sup>, that is `2x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. Hence, the sum of the areas of the squares on all three sides of the triangle is `(x^2 + x^2 + 2x^2)` cm<sup>2</sup> `= 4x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>. It follows that `4x^2 = 72` and hence that `x^2 = 18`.

The triangle is half of a square measuring `x` cm `× x` cm. Therefore the triangle has area `1/2 x^2` cm<sup>2</sup>.  

It follows that the area of the triangle is 9 cm<sup>2</sup>.

<!--- (2016) Q25 --->

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
![](/resources/10-09-paper-mysteries/5-tiling.jpg){image align="right"}
__5.1__ The tiling pattern shown uses two types of tile, regular hexagons and equilateral triangles, with the length of each side of the equilateral triangles equal to half the length of the sides of each side of the hexagons. A large number of tiles is used to cover a floor.  

Which of the following is closest to the fraction of the floor that is shaded black?

* [ ] `1/8`
* [ ] `1/10`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [x] `1/13`
* [ ] `1/16`

We see that the entire plane can be tessellated by the shape labelled `S` in the above diagram. This shape is made up of one tile in the shape of a regular hexagon and two tiles in the shape of equilateral triangles.

We see that the entire plane can be tessellated by the shape labelled `S` in the diagram. This shape is made up of one tile in the shape of a regular hexagon and two tiles in the shape of equilateral triangles.  

The diagram shows that, as the side length of the triangular tiles is half that of the hexagonal tiles, the area of the hexagonal tiles is 24 times the area of the triangular tiles.  

[This may be seen by counting the number of small triangles, each congruent to the triangular tiles, into which the hexagonal tile is divided by the dashed lines.  

Alternatively, we see that the hexagonal tile may be divided into 6 equilateral triangles each with side length twice that of the triangular tiles, and hence each with an area 4 times that of the triangular tiles. It follows that the area of the hexagonal tile is 6 `×` 4, that is, 24, times that of the triangular tiles.]  

Therefore the shape `S` is made up of 2 black triangles and a hexagon equal in area to 24 of the black triangles. So the total area of `S` is equal to that of 2 + 24 = 26 of the triangles.  

It follows that the fraction of the area of `S` that is black is `2/26 = 1/13`.  

A large area of the floor will be covered by a large number of tiles which make up shapes congruent to `S`, together with a few bits of tiles. Therefore the fraction of the floor that is shaded black will be very close to `1/13`.
