# Troubleshooting

### We are not receiving emails from Parallel (e.g., password reset emails or weekly reminder emails).

In order for pupils to receive the weekly email reminder to take part in the latest Parallelograms and successfully manage their account and password, you may need your school's IT department to whitelist the following addresses:

* noreply@parallel-cf800.firebaseapp.com
* https://parallel-cf800.firebaseapp.com
* contact@parallel.org.uk
* https://parallel.org.uk/


### Some of my students claim that they cannot login to Parallel and cannot reset their password.

This could be a genuine problem. For example, a student might forget their password and a school firewall might be blocking the email that would help reset the password. Year students in particular might struggle with password management. However, it is also possible that students are deliberately forgetting passwords in order to avoid doing Parallelograms. There are three approaches to solving the problem, including two that are more or less foolproof:

1.	Instead of using school email address, ask students to use personal email addresses, which should not have the same firewall problems.
2.	Allow students to use school or personal email addresses, but keep a record of the email address used and the password in case they are forgotten.
3.	We do not require a genuine email address, so you can create a fake email ID and password for each student, which the student can use to access Parallel. You should keep a record of each email and password. You should create fake email IDs that are very unlikely to exist. For example, you could you create the account:  

* username: AnneSmith147@paralleltoptopset.org.uk             
* password: 135162  

The domain does not exist (and you are welcome to use it), _AnneSmith147_ is probably unique and the password is hard to guess. The only negative of this approach is that the student will not be able to receive weekly reminder emails from Parallel.

The only way for student to sabotage (2) or (3) is for the student to sign in, change the password and then pretend they donâ€™t know the new password. However, this is a strong indication that the student is actively working to avoid Parallel. If you want them to continue, you could create a new account with a new fake email and password. The only disadvantage is that students will lost past badges and past scores linked to their old accounts.
