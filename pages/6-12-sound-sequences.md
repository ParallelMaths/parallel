# The Sound Of Sequences

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. The Recamán Sequence

A swirly sequence which takes unpredictable turns, where will it land next?  

Watch this video from Alex Bellos to explore this unusual sequence and then answer the questions below.

@[youtube](FGC5TdIiT9U?rel=0) _(If you have problems watching the video, right click to open it in a new window)_

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What is the rule for deciding the direction in the Recamán Sequence?

* [ ] alternating back then forwards
* [ ] always forward, unless you can’t, in which case go back
* [x] always back, unless you can’t, in which case go forwards
* [ ] odd lengths go back, even lengths go forward

---

The Recamán Sequence is described as "always back, unless you can't, then forward"
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ Will all of the numbers be covered?

* [ ] Yes, definitely
* [ ] Absolutely not
* [x] We don’t have a proof yet

---

This is an open question in maths. Perhaps someone who is doing this Parallelogram could figure it out in the future!
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ How is the musical version of the Recamán Sequence described?

* [ ] always increasing
* [ ] always decreasing
* [x] contrary motion (going both up and down at the same time)

---

Like the fugues of Bach and many other fantastic musicians, the Recamán sequence displays the musical concept of contrary motion.
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ What are the first five terms of the Recamán Sequence?

* [x] 0, 1, 3, 6, 2
* [ ] 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
* [ ] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* [ ] 1, 2, 4, 7, 3
:::


# 2. An interesting sequence from a past UKMT challenge

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
__2.1__"Mad Teacher Disease" is spreading.  

Each week it spreads from teacher to teacher, shown as the dots in the pentagonal diagrams.  

How many teachers will be affected by week 6?

![](/resources/6-12-sound-sequences/2-pentagon-sequence.png){image align="center"}

* [ ] 35
* [ ] 48
* [x] 51
* [ ] 54
* [ ] 67
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
First look at the number of new teachers infected each week, is there another pattern there?
^^^
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks = 2
__2.2__ How many teachers will be infected by week 8?

<input type="number" solution="92"/>

---

By day 8 there will be 35 + 16 + 19 + 22 = 92 cases.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
