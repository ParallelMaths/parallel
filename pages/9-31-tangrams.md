## 1. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2014 (5) --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ A ship’s bell is struck every half hour, starting with one bell at 0030, two bells (meaning the bell is struck twice) at 0100, three bells at 0130 until the cycle is complete with eight bells at 0400. The cycle then starts again with one bell at 0430, two bells at 0500 and so on. What is the total number of times the bell is struck between 0015 on one day and 0015 on the following day?

* [ ] 24
* [ ] 48
* [ ] 108
* [ ] 144
* [x] 216
{.col-5}

---

In a single cycle of 4 hours the bell is struck `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36` times. In a 24 hour day there are 6 of these cycles. So in the 24 hours between 0015 one day and 0015 the next day the bell is struck `6 × 36 = 216` times.

## 2. Missing letter

Here is a puzzle via mathematics specialist teacher and former headteacher Drew Foster (@drewfoster0 on Twitter). If you can’t solve it, blame him, not me.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
![](/resources/9-31-tangrams/3-dice.png){image align="right"}
__3.1__  A large cube is made by stacking eight dice. The diagram shows the result, except that one of the dice is missing.  

Each die has faces with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 pips and the total number of pips on opposite faces is 7.   

When two dice are placed face to face, the matching faces must have the same number of pips.  

What could the missing die look like?

^^^ hint id=3_1
Although all standard dice have pips adding up to 7 on opposite faces, dice can vary according to their orientation.

![](/resources/9-31-tangrams/3-dice-hint.png)

From the diagrams above, we see that the faces with 4, 5 and 5 pips go round the vertex where these faces meet in clockwise order (left) or in an anticlockwise order (right).

Although all standard dice have pips adding up to 7 on opposite faces, dice can vary according to their orientation. From the diagram showing the completed cube on the left below, we see that, for the missing die, the faces with 1, 3 and 5 pips go round the vertex where these faces meet in clockwise order. [In a differently oriented die, these faces would go round anti-clockwise. If you have a die to hand, check how these faces are oriented on it.]  

So we need to decide which of the dice given as options have this orientation of these three faces. In the die of option A, the face with 3 pips is on the bottom, and we can visualize that the 1, 3 and 5 pip faces go round in anti-clockwise order. In the die of option B, the face with 5 pips is the opposite face to that with 2 pips, and we can again visualize that the 1, 3 and 5 pip faces go round anticlockwise. In the die of option C the face with 3 pips is opposite the face with 4 pips, and the face with 5 pips is opposite that with 2 pips. You should be able to visualize that this means that the faces with 1, 3 and 5 go round in clockwise order. So C is the correct option.  

Of course, to complete the question, we really need to check that in the dice of options D and E the 1, 3 and 5 pip faces go round in anti-clockwise order. This is left to you to do.

## 4. Tangram

The journalist Alex Bellos, who has written some terrific books about mathematics (e.g., Alex's Adventures in Numberland) and football (e.g., Football School Season 1: Where Football Explains the World), penned an interesting newspaper column about the tangram. According to Alex, tangram was first ever puzzle craze.  

First, you should [read the article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/22/can-you-solve-it-the-puzzle-that-is-donald-trump){target="_blank"}.  

Then, [have a play with this great tangram webpage](https://mathigon.org/explore/tangram/){target="_blank"} from Mathigon, a website dedicated to mathematics education.
See if you can create some of the tangram patterns.


## 5. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2014 (19) --->

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ Suppose that `8^m = 27`. What is the value of `4^m`?

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 9
* [ ] 13.5
* [ ] there is no such `m`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5_1
Notice that `8 = 2^3`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=5_2
Notice that `27 = 3^3`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=5_3
So `8^m = 27` may be written as `(2^3)^m = 3^3`.
^^^

---

Notice that `8 = 2^3` and `27 = 3^3`. So `8^m = 27` may be written as `(2^3)^m = 3^3`.

So `2^(3m) = 3^3`, and hence `(2^m)^3 = 3^3`. It follows that `2^m = 3`. So `4^m = (2^2)^m = 2^(2m) = (2^m)^2 = 3^2 = 9`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
