1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. A puzzle you can use your calculator for!

Watch this video of where maths teacher and author, Chris Smith, takes chess knights out of their normal realm and into the world of numbers.

Pause the video when prompted and give yourself three minutes to think about the puzzle before watching the answer!

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Starting from the 6, where can the knight move to?

* [ ] 8 and 2
* [x] 7 and 1
* [ ] 3 and 9
* [ ] 0 and 7
{.col-4}
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ Which button only has one available move when the knight is placed on it?

* [x] 5
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 7
{.col-4}
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ Using the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 exactly once, along with the four operations add, subtract, multiply and divide - and () if you need them - what is the largest number you can make?  

For example, (1 + 2 + 3) × 4 = 24, but I am sure you can do better than that!

* [ ] 25
* [ ] 30
* [x] 36
* [ ] 42
{.col-4}

At first you may think of multiplying them all together 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24, but then notice that the 1 is not adding value to this sum.

We could then multiply all of the numbers and then add the 1: 2 × 3 × 4 + 1 = 25

But we can do even better!

It is possible to make 36 by adding the 1 to the 2 first, and then multiplying: (1 + 2) × 3 × 4 = 36

## 2. Cube Loop
![](/resources/6-28-number-knights/2-cube-loop.png){image align="right"}  
Chris Smith, Scotland’s nerd in shining armor, also noticed a peculiar property of the number 136.  

If you cube the digits then add them, you get 244:  
* `1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 = 244`

And then if you follow the same process with 244, you get back to 136!  
* `2^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 = 136`


::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Which of the following numbers have the same property?

* [ ] 616
* [ ] 666
* [x] 919
* [ ] 999
{.col-4}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
![](/resources/6-28-number-knights/2-cube-loop-2.png){image align="right"}  
__2.2__ This same process can even form a loop of 3.

* `1^3 + 6^3 + 0^3 = 352`
* `3^3 + 5^3 + 2^3 = 217`
* `2^3 + 1^3 + 7^3 = 160`

Which of the following numbers also creates a loop of 3 when the digits are cubed and added?

* [x] 55
* [ ] 66
* [ ] 77
* [ ] 88
{.col-4}

![](/resources/6-28-number-knights/2-cube-loop-answer-2.png){image align="right"}  
* `5^3 + 5^3 = 250`  
  
* `2^3 + 5^3 + 0^3 = 133`  
  
* `1^3 + 3^3 + 3^3 = 55`

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
