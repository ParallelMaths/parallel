# Superstar maths teacher needed for Good Thinking’s maths initiatives

## About us

Bestselling science author Simon Singh is on a mission to increase the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians, and he needs your help!

Over the past seven years, Simon’s charity, Good Thinking, has developed several initiatives to develop the maths skills of bright students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The goal is to enable these students to pursue maths-based STEM degrees at the best universities. Our current projects include:

* The Maths Masterclass Tutorials programme, a collaboration with tutoring charity TalentEd & MESME, in which we’re supporting hundreds of secondary maths students through a five-year course of enrichment maths via weekly small-group tutorials.
* The Monthly Maths Challenge, an innovative large-scale webinar series that currently reaches 1,000 Year 7 students, with plans to expand globally to multiple year groups.
* A pilot programme for Year 6 students that seizes upon the best of both the webinar and tutorial formats.
* The Parallel website ([parallel.org.uk](/)), which contains weekly engaging worksheets for Years 7-11 used by 5,000 students each week. It is poised to incorporate a range of new interactive features.
* A series of guest lectures, a board game club, chess tournaments, quizzes and other events that galvanise our online presence and ensure students are engaged with a range of maths learning experiences all year round.

We’re seeking a new team member who can drive these projects, optimise our delivery and impact, and help design new initiatives and resources.


## About the role

This is a remote role with flexible hours - this could be a part or full time position depending on your circumstances and ambitions.  

You’ll have the opportunity to work closely (albeit virtually for the most part) with Simon himself, as well as leading maths educator (and Countdown winner) Junaid Mubeen. As a ‘founding member’ of our team you will have the space to bring your own ideas to the table, and to shape our work as we strive to develop the world’s largest community of budding young mathematicians.

In the first 6-12 months you will help us to:

* Launch our global online maths webinars and manage programme delivery.
* Reach out to schools, maths hubs and other relevant institutions to raise awareness of our work and attract the brightest students from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply for our programmes.
* Co-create high quality, engaging maths content for relevant offerings.
* Evolve the Parallel website to include a wider range of resources and offerings.
* Manage and help expand our calendar of regular events.

If you are keen to remain in teaching on a part-time basis as you pursue this role, we are happy to explore options with you. We have a range of teaching opportunities through our own programmes and would be happy to consider your own ideas.


## About you

You share our passion for equalising opportunities for talented students who may otherwise be left on the margins. You are excited to help us figure out how to expand our current offerings to thousands of students worldwide.

You may not be a ‘techie’ but you are always excited to explore new tools and technologies, particularly when you see the potential for them to enhance the online learning and teaching experience. A flavour of the tools we’re currently working with: Calendly, Mailerlite, OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Trello, Kahoot! In time, you will be expected to be across all of these tools, and will recommend new and improved ways of working.

You have a maths-based STEM degree and have taught at secondary level, ideally in a school setting (or as a private tutor otherwise), and you can empathise with the need to stretch high-potential students with rich maths content.

You thrive on the autonomy of independent work, are comfortable with ambiguity, and are unafraid to challenge assumptions and present your own ideas.

At the same time, you have ruthless attention to detail, take pride in how organised you are, and never miss a deadline without good reason.

You have excellent written and verbal communication skills.
