# Parallel Academy Year 9 Easter Problem Solving Paper

To begin your Easter homework, [open this Problem Solving paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12doI2BY77Xu7T972QKvojWRN8K_CqHDl/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"}.  

The problems are from mathematical challenges set outside of the United Kingdom.  

This paper is provided to help you keep your problem solving skills sharp over the Easter holiday and the score will _not_ contribute to next term's report. 

The first ten questions are multiple-choice and intended to be completed in one sitting, allowing yourself up to 30 minutes to complete.

The final five questions require you to calculate a numerical answer and are intended to be much more challenging.

We recommend that you tackle these five questions one at a time, rather than in one sitting, allowing yourself up to 90 minutes (in total) to complete them.  

You must _not_ use a calculator unless you think it is essential in a given problem because the level of mental arithmetic required is unreasonable.    

After you have submitted your answers, you will be able to see which questions you got right and wrong, but not the solutions. We encourage you to come back to the questions you got wrong or did not get around to attempting the first time.  

We will then share full solutions with you just before the start of the summer term.
