*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. With great power comes great responsibility

A number so large the mind boggles, its impossible to write it all down, and if you tried you would become googley eyed - yes, its the googolplex!  

Watch this video where Tony Padilla and Ria Symonds try to explain just how ginormous this number is.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ How many zeros does a googol have?

* [ ] ten
* [x] one hundred
* [ ] one thousand
* [ ] one million

---

A googol is 10<sup>100</sup> so it has 100 zeros
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ How many zeros does a googolplex have?

* [ ] one hundred
* [ ] ten hundred
* [x] a googol
* [ ] one hundred million

---

A googolplex is 10<sup>a googol</sup>, so it has a googol zeros.
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ Which of these represents a million?

* [ ] `10^3`
* [ ] `10^4`
* [ ] `10^5`
* [x] `10^6`
{.col-4}

---

A million has six zeros, so 1,000,000 can be written as `10^6`
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ How many zeros are left after you divide a Googolplex by a Googol?

* [ ] none
* [ ] a Googol
* [x] a Googol - 100
* [ ] one

---

To divide numbers with indices we can subtract the index.  

Think about `100000/100` we know the answer would be 1000.  

Now consider what it would look like in index form,  

`10^5/10^2 = 10^3`

it is as if we have subtracted the indices.  

Now apply this to a googolplex divided by a googol:  

10<sup>a googol</sup> / 10<sup>100</sup> = 10<sup>a googol - 100</sup>.

## 2. I've Got The Power!

Try these past UKMT Primary Maths Challenge puzzle questions:

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ You are given that `p = 3`, `q = 2`, and `p^3 × q^2 × r = 432`.  

What is the value of `r`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}
---

After doing the substitution we have the equation:  

`3^3 × 2^2 × r = 432`  
`27 × 4 × r = 432`  
`108r = 432`  
`r = 432/108`  

so `r = 4`

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
