It’s the end of Christmaths, so here is your last instalment of your Christmaths maths challenge paper!

Simon.

## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
How many minutes will elapse between 20:12 today and 21:02 tomorrow?

* [ ] A) 50
* [ ] B) 770
* [ ] C) 1250
* [x] D) 1490
* [ ] E) 2450
{.col-5}

---

From 20:12 today until 20.12 tomorrow is 24 hours, that is 24 × 60 = 1440 minutes. There are 50 minutes from 20:12 tomorrow to 21:02 tomorrow. This gives a total of 1440 + 50 = 1490 minutes.

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
An ‘abundant’ number is a positive integer `N`, such that the sum of the factors of `N` (excluding `N` itself) is greater than `N`.

What is the smallest abundant number?

* [ ] A) 5
* [ ] B) 6
* [ ] C) 10
* [x] D) 12
* [ ] E) 15
{.col-5}

---

In the IMC, it is only necessary to check the factors of the numbers given as the options.

However, to be sure that the smallest of these which is abundant, is the overall smallest abundant number, we would need to check the factors of all the positive integers in turn, until we find an abundant number.

The following table gives the sum of the factors of `N` (excluding `N` itself), for `1 ≤ N ≤ 12`.

From this table we see that 12 is the smallest abundant number.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
Which of the following has a value that is closest to 0?

* [ ] A) `1/2 + 1/3 × 1/4`
* [ ] B) `1/2 + 1/3 ÷ 1/4`
* [ ] C) `1/2 × 1/3 ÷ 1/4`
* [ ] D) `1/2 - 1/3 ÷ 1/4`
* [x] E) `1/2 - 1/3 × 1/4`
{.col-3}

When working out the values of these expressions it is important to remember the convention (sometimes known as BODMAS or BIDMAS) that tells us that Divisions and Multiplications are carried out before Additions and Subtractions.  

Some work can be saved by noting that the expressions A and B have values greater than `1/2`, whereas the value of expression E lies between 0 and `1/2`. So it must be C, D or E that has the value closest to 0.

Now, noting that `1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/3 × 4/1 = 4/3`,  
we obtain that the value of C is `1/2 × 1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/2 × 4/3 = 2/3`;  
that of D is `1/2 - 1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/2 - 4/3 = -(5/6)`;  
and that of E is `1/2 - 1/3 × 1/4 = 1/2 - 1/12 = 5/12`.

From these calculations we see that E gives the value closest to 0.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
A rectangle with area 125 cm<sup>2</sup> has sides in the ratio 4:5. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?

* [ ] A) 18 cm
* [ ] B) 22.5 cm
* [ ] C) 36 cm
* [x] D) 45 cm
* [ ] E) 54 cm
{.col-5}

---

Since the side lengths of the rectangle are in the ratio 4:5, they are `4a` cm and `5a` cm, for some positive number `a`.  

This means that the rectangle has area `4a × 5a = 20a^2 cm^2`.

Hence `20a^2 = 125`. So `a^2` = `125/20 = 25/4`, and hence `a = 5/2`.

Hence the rectangle has perimeter `2(4a + 5a) = 18a = 18 × 5/2 = 45` cm.

The diagram shows a ceramic design by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.  

It is formed by drawing eight lines connecting points which divide the edges of the outer regular octagon into three equal parts, as shown.  

What fraction of the octagon is shaded?

* [ ] A) `1/5`
* [x] B) `2/9`
* [ ] C) `1/4`
* [ ] D) `3/10`
* [ ] E) `5/16`
{.col-5}

We consider the triangular segment of the octagon formed by joining two adjacent vertices, `P` and `Q` to the centre, `O`. For convenience, we show this segment, drawn on a larger scale, on the right, where we have added the lines `RW, ST, TW` and `UV`.  

These lines are parallel to the edges of the triangle `POQ`, as shown and together with the lines `RU` and `SV` they divide the triangle `OPQ` into 9 congruent triangles, of which 2 are shaded.

Thus `2/9` of the segment is shaded. The same holds for all the other congruent segments of the octagon.

So `2/9` of the whole octagon is shaded.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
