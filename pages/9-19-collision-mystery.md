*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	As many of you will on half term next week, you have an extra week to finish this parallelogram.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.
* As it is half-term, you have a bit of extra time to complete this Parallelogram. You should finish it by Sunday 24. And the next Parallelogram will appear on Thursday 28 February.


## 1.	Collision mystery

This video from the brilliant “3 Blue 1 Brown” YouTube channel posing an interesting puzzle with a very unexpected answer. Take a look and answer the questions below:

@[youtube](HEfHFsfGXjs?rel=0)

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ The video shows how you can calculate the value of a number by bouncing two blocks against each other. What is that number?

* [x] Pi
* [ ] Square root of pi
* [ ] Square root of 2
* [ ] Square root of -1
* [ ] The golden ratio
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ If you want to calculate 20 digits of pi, and one block weights 1 Kg, how much must the other block weigh?

* [ ] The weight of a bowling ball
* [ ] The weight of a human
* [ ] The weight of an elephant
* [ ] The weight of Earth
* [ ] The weight of the Sun
* [x] The weight of a supermassive black hole

## 2. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2013 (3) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
![](/resources/9-19-collision-mystery/2-quadrilaterals.jpg){image align="right"}
__2.1.__ How many quadrilaterals are there is this diagram, which is constructed using 6 straight lines?

* [ ] 4  
* [ ] 5  
* [ ] 7  
* [ ] 8  
* [x] 9  

---

In a question of this type we need to try and find a systematic approach so that we count all the quadrilaterals but do not count any of them twice. The method we use (there are others) is to count all the quadrilaterals according to how many of the four smaller quadrilaterals shown in the diagram make them up.  

We see that there are 4 quadrilaterals each made up of just one of the small quadrilaterals, 4 made up of two of the smaller quadrilaterals, and 1 made up of all four of the smaller quadrilaterals.  

This makes a total of 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 quadrilaterals altogether. These are shown in the diagram below.

## 3. The Mathematical Art Of M.C. Escher

If you have never seen any M.C. Escher’s art, then I think you will find this video fascinating. Just take a look and then answer the two questions below.

@[youtube](Kcc56fRtrKU?rel=0)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__ Which object, invented by Roger Penrose, inspired Escher?

* [ ] Impossible line  
* [x] Impossible triangle	 
* [ ] Impossible square  
* [ ] Impossible quadrilateral  
* [ ] Impossible cube  
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=2
__3.2.__ Escher was intrigued by the Möbius strip. What property does it have?

* [ ] It has only one dimension  
* [x] It has only one side  
* [ ] It is infinitely long  
* [ ] It has three ends  
* [ ] It cannot be constructed

## 4. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2013 (15) --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1.__ I have a bag of coins. In it, one third of the coins are gold, one fifth of them are silver, two sevenths are bronze and the rest are copper.  

My bag can hold a maximum of 200 coins. How many coins are in my bag?

* [ ] 101
* [x] 105
* [ ] 153
* [ ] 195
* [ ] more information is needed
{.col-4}

---

Since one third of the coins are gold, and we cannot have fractions of a coin, the number of coins in the bag must be divisible by 3.  

Similarly, this number must also be divisible by 5 and by 7. A number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7 if, and only if, it is a multiple of 3 × 5 × 7 = 105.  

Since my bag holds at most 200 coins, the only possibility is that there are 105 coins in my bag.
:::

::: problem id=4_2 marks=3
__4.2.__ I have another bag of coins. In it, one quarter of the coins are gold, one third of them are silver, one fifth of them are bronze and the rest are copper.  

What is the smallest number of coins I could have in my bag?

<input type="number" solution="60"/>  

---

The bag must have a number of coins that is a multiple of 3, 4 and 5, and the smallest such number is 60.
:::

::: problem id=4_3 marks=3
__4.3.__ I have yet another bag of coins. In it, one quarter of the coins are gold, one twelfth of them are silver, three tenths are bronze and the rest are copper.  

What is the smallest number of coins I could have in my bag?

<input type="number" solution="60"/>  

---

The bag must have a number of coins that is a multiple of 4, 10 and 12, but any number that is a multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 4, so we only need to worry about 10 and 12.

You might think the answer is 120 (ie 10 x 12), but 10 and 12 have a common factor of 2, so we only need to worry about 5 and 12. So the answer is 60 (ie 5 x 12).

## 5. More Escher

No questions and no marks – just take a look at this videos which takes you on a flight through weird world of M.C. Escher.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge… if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means your learn lots from your mistakes.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, back and complete them.
*	You earn reward points and badges from completing missed Parallelogams.
*	As it is half-term, you have a bit of extra time to complete this Parallelogram. You should finish it by Sunday 24. And the next Parallelogram will appear on Thursday 28 February.

Cheerio,
Simon.
