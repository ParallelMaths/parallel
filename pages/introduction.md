# More about the Parallel Maths Project
 
Hello Rookie Mathematician,
 
In order to be reading this page you must be slightly weird, by which I mean you are a keen mathematician. You might be in the Top-Top Set in your school, your teacher or parent might have recommended you, or you might have received one of our tweets (@ParallelMaths).
 
Alternatively, you might have hacked into our mailing list, in which case you clearly have the right sort of enthusiasm (but perhaps not the right morals) to be part of the project.
 
(BTW, your teacher (or me) might already have sent you this message via email – if so, then you can skip this page by clicking here. BUT DO NOT SKIP THIS PAGE IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT.)
 
The good news is that each Friday at 4pm, from June 30 to July 21, you will have access to a new set of online mathematical challenges – each set of challenges is called a Parallelogram. 
 
It should take 60 to 90 minutes to complete each Parallelogram. If you quit and return to the Challenges, then your previous answers will be saved 
 
You have until 7.30pm on Sunday to complete the challenge and hit the SUBMIT button..
 
One minute later, at 7.31pm, you will find that that an answer sheet has been posted onto the site and you will be able to find out your score.
 
Why is this project called ‘parallel’? Well, parallel lines don’t cross over – check with Euclid if you don’t believe me – and in general the challenges that I set you will not cross over with what you are doing in school. These maths challenges are often going to involve ideas that are in the unexplored universe of numbers. 
 
You are going to be entering a peculiar Numberverse, and some of the puzzles, riddles and problems that you encounter will make your brain ache. But don’t worry, doing real maths means meeting difficult ideas and having to wrestle with them. If too many of you find the challenges too easy, then I am doing something wrong. At the same time, I think you will be able to do most of the challenges, otherwise you would not be on this website.
 
What will the challenges look like? Be prepared for anything. They will involve paradoxes, maths history, videos, songs, online articles, online lectures, deep maths, weird maths, funny maths and maths in the headlines.
 
What do you do if you get stuck? First, you try harder. Second, you try even harder. Third, you try until it hurts. However, I am not cruel, so there will be hint buttons if you are really stuck, and you can also talk to your family or classmates. And, if you still get the answer wrong, then that is no problem. It just means that you will learn even more when you see the answer sheet.
 
Moreover, there will be an online tutorial session at 8pm on Sunday. During the tutorial, you will be online with about hundred other students, so please don’t all shout at once. Better still, you can email us before the online tutorial and that will give me a chance to think about which areas you found tricky. You will find details about the online tutorial on our website www.parallel.org.uk/online-tutorial 
 
Before I sign off, you might wonder who is writing this email. 
When I was your age, I loved maths. I definitely wasn’t the best in the class and I often found maths hard, but I always enjoyed the challenge and learned to be determined. My parents left school when they were very young (and mum still can’t read or write), so they were both very keen that I made the best of my time at school … and sure enough I left school and earned a place to study physics at Imperial College in London, and then I went to Cambridge University and CERN and completed a doctorate (a PhD) in particle physics. We were messing around antimatter, bosons and quarks – all very exciting. Since then, I have written books and presented radio and TV programmes about maths and science, and now I am creating Parallel maths challenges for you.

Come and say hello at Sunday’s online tutorial. It’s optional, but try to be at the first one to see if you find it useful. 
 
Now… what you are waiting for … just click here for your first set of challenges.
 
Cheerio,
Dr Singh
