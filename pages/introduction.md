# Hello Rookie Mathematician,

In order to be reading this page and to have got this far, you must be slightly kooky, by which I mean you are a keen mathematician who is hungry to explore the mathematical universe.  

The Parallel website offers two great ways for you to learn some cool ideas, stretch your brain and explore the wild west of mathematics.  

__Parallelograms__

Each Thursday at 3pm (UK time), you will have access to a new set of online mathematical challenges tailored to your age – each set of challenges is called a Parallelogram. It should take just 15 to 30 minutes to complete each Parallelogram. If you quit and return to the Challenges, then your previous answers will be saved.  

As soon as you hit the SUBMIT button, you will be able to see the answers as well as your score. Most importantly of all, make sure you go through the solution sheet and try to learn from your mistakes.  

You will earn points depending on your percentage score on each Parallelogram, which in turn will earn you mathematical badges.  

You are going to be entering a peculiar Numberverse, and some of the puzzles, riddles and problems that you encounter in Parallelograms and Parallel Circles will make your brain ache. But don’t worry, doing real maths means meeting difficult ideas and having to wrestle with them. If too many of you find the challenges too easy, then we are doing something wrong. At the same time, I think you will be able to do most of the challenges, otherwise you would not be on this website.  

Cheerio,  
Dr Singh  

PS: Before I sign off, you might wonder who is writing this email. When I was your age, I loved maths. I definitely wasn’t the best in the class and I often found maths hard, but I always enjoyed the challenge and learned to be determined.

My parents grew up in India in the 1930s and did not have a proper education (and my mum still can’t read or write), so they were both very keen that I made the best of my time at school... and sure enough I left school and earned a place to study physics at Imperial College in London, and then I went to Cambridge University and CERN and completed a doctorate (a PhD) in particle physics. We were messing around with antimatter, bosons and quarks – all very exciting. Since then, I have written books and presented radio/TV programmes about maths/science, and now I am creating the Parallel universe for students who love maths and who want to work towards a future in science, technology, engineering, computing, economics or mathematics.
