![](/resources/module-2-test-spring/2-quadrilateral.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="100"/> 

---

Angles in a quadrilateral sum to 360°, so the missing angle, in degrees, is 360 - (155 + 55 + 50) = 100
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If there are twice as many girls as there are boys in a class, what is the ratio of boys to girls? 

* [ ] 1:1
* [x] 1:2
* [ ] 1:3
* [ ] 2:1
* [ ] 3:1
{.col-5}

---

For every boy there are two girls, so the ratio of boys to girls is 1:2.
:::


## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is divisible by 2, 3 and 4? 

* [ ] 238
* [ ] 239
* [x] 240
* [ ] 241
* [ ] 242
{.col-5}

---

* 239 and 241 are odd and are therefore not divisible by 2   
* 238 and 242 are not divisible by 3 or 4 (use either divisibility check) 
* 240 is 24 × 10 and 24 = 2 × 3 × 4, so we can see that 240 contains these three factors 
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
Which of these is a regular quadrilateral? 

* [ ] Parallelogram
* [ ] Kite
* [ ] Rectangle
* [ ] Rhombus
* [x] Square

---

Regular means that all the sides have the same length and all the interior angles are equal (90° in the case of a quadrilateral).  

Only a square fits this description.  
:::


## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is smallest? 

* [x] `2^5`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `6^2`
* [ ] `2^6`
* [ ] `8^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are: 

* `2^5 = 32`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `6^2 = 36`
* `2^6 = 64`
* `8^2 = 64`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What is the mean of the numbers 6, 6, 8, 10, 15? 

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

---

There are five numbers in the list so the mean is given by: 

`(6 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 15)/5 = 9`
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what is the probability that you get two sixes?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `1/36`
* [ ] `1/18`
{.col-5}

---

The probability is given by:  

`1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36`
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
The number of diagonals in a regular polygon is 44. How many sides does the polygon have?  

* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [x] 11
* [ ] 12
{.col-5}

---

Here are the first few regular polygons:

| Number of sides | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Number of diagonals | 0 | 2 | 5 | 9 | 14 | 20 |
{.grid}

The amount that the number of diagonals increases by goes up by one more each time.  

Continuing this pattern, a 9-sided shape has 27 diagonals (add 7), a 10-sided shape has 35 diagonals (add 8), and an 11-sided shape has 44 diagonals (add 9).  

In general, the number of diagonals for an n-sided regular polygon is `n(n - 3)/2`, so we have essentially solved the equation `n(n - 3)/2 = 44`.  
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
When the diagram below is complete, the number in the middle of each group of 3 adjoining cells is the mean of its two neighbours.  

What number goes in the right-hand end cell?

![](/resources/module-3-test-spring/10-grid.png){image align="center"}


<input type="number" solution="29"/>

---

We saw in Module 3 that the sequence of numbers increases by the same amount each time.  

Since three boxes are separated by a distance of 18, this means the sequence goes up by 6 each time and the right-hand end cell is therefore 23 + 6 = 29.  
:::


## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
The diagram shows a regular hexagon PQRSTU, a square PQVW and an equilateral triangle VXW. 

![](/resources/module-3-test-spring/11-hexagon.png){image align="centre"}

What is the size of angle QVR, in degrees?  

* [ ] 55
* [ ] 65
* [ ] 70
* [x] 75
* [ ] 80
{.col-5}


---

The internal angle of a regular hexagon is 120° and angle VQP is a right-angle, so angle VQR is 120° – 90° = 30°.

VQ and QR have the same length as they are both equal in length to PQ (VQ = PQ as they are sides of a square and QR = PQ as they are sides of a regular hexagon).  

Therefore triangle VQR is isosceles and angles QVR and QRV share the remaining 150°.  

So angle QVR is 75°.  
:::


## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
What fraction of the integers from 1 to 64,000 inclusive are cubes?

* [ ] `1/64`
* [x] `1/1600`
* [ ] `1/2000`
* [ ] `1/16000`
* [ ] `1/200`
{.col-5}

---

Since 64,000 = `40^3`, there are 40 cubes in the range, giving a fraction of `40/64000`.

This simplifies to `1/1600`.
:::


## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
How many four-digit numbers have an odd number of factors?

<input type="number" solution="68"/>

---

The numbers that have an odd number of factors are square numbers, so we want to know how many square numbers there are between 1000 and 9999.  

Since 10,000 = `100^2`, the largest square in this range is `99^2`.  

The smallest square in the range is `1024 = 32^2`.  

Therefore there are `99 – 32 + 1 = 68` such four-digit numbers.
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-3-test-spring/14-moron.png){image align="right"}
The Morón rectangle is made of nine different sized squares.  

The lengths of the sides of these squares are 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 18.  

What is the perimeter of the rectangle?  

<input type="number" solution="130"/>

---

The two topmost squares correspond to the third largest and largest of the nine squares, so they have side lengths 14 and 18, respectively.  

Therefore the horizontal length of the rectangle is 32.  

Similarly, the vertical length of the rectangle is 18 + 15 = 33 (because the two rightmost squares are the two largest).  

So the perimeter is 2 × (32 + 33) = 130.

## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-2-test-spring/15-square.png){image align="right"}
The diagram shows a large square which has been divided into four smaller squares.  

It also shows both diagonals of the large square and two diagonals of the smaller squares.  

What fraction of the area of the large square has been shaded? 

* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [ ] `5/8`
* [x] `9/16`
* [ ] `11/16`

---

* Starting on the top left square and going clockwise, the shaded parts make up `1/2`,`1/2`,`3/4` and `1/2` of their respective squares.   
* Each of the four squares is `1/4` of the whole square, so, as a fraction of the whole square, the shaded parts are `1/8`, `1/8`, `3/16` and `1/8`. 
* Sum these to get a total fraction of `9/16`. 
:::


## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
Abby has half as many apples as Mahika.  

Lily has twice as many apples as Abby.  

What fraction of all their apples does Lily have? 

* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `2/5`
* [ ] `3/5`
* [ ] `4/5`
* [ ] `1/10`
{.col-5}

---

* Let `x` be the number of apples that Abby has. 
* Then Mahika as `2x` apples and Lily has `2x` apples. 
* So Lily has `2x` apples out of a total of `5x` apples, i.e. she has `2/5` of the apples.

A hexagon is formed by arranging three equilateral triangles, as shown in the diagram.  

The side-length of the largest equilateral triangle is 15cm.  

What is the perimeter, in cm, of the hexagon?

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 45
* [x] 60
* [ ] 75
* [ ] more information needed

---

Let the side-lengths, in cm, of the two smaller triangles be `x` and `y`, as shown.  

Then from the dotted line we can see that `x + y = 15`.  

The perimeter of the hexagon, in cm, is therefore:  

`15 + 15 + 2x + 2y = 30 + 2(x + y) = 30 + 30 = 60`

## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
The digits 1, 3, 6, 5 and 7 are to be placed in the grid, one to a cell, to make a correct mathematical statement.  

What number should come immediately after the division sign?  

![](/resources/module-2-test-spring/18-grid.png){image align="center"}

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 7
{.col-5}

---

The only correct statement that uses these digits is `35 ÷ 7 + 1 = 6`.

PWRS is a square with area 64 cm<sup>2</sup>`.  

The point T is inside the square.  

PTS is a triangle with area 17 cm<sup>2</sup>.  

What is the area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of the triangle QRT?  

* [ ] 14
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17
* [ ] 18
{.col-5}

Denote the perpendicular heights of PTS and QRT h₁, h₂, respectively.  

The base of both triangles is the side length of the square, which is 8cm.   

So the areas of QRT and PTS are (in cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively, `1/2` × 8 × h₁ and `1/2` × 8 × h₂.  

The sum of these two areas is `1/2` × 8 × (h₁ + h₂).  

Now, h₁ + h₂  is the height of the square, so this simplifies to `1/2 × 8 × 8 = 32`.  

So the two triangles have a combined area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of 32 and since we are told that PTS has an area of 17 cm<sup>2</sup>, triangle QRT must make up the remaining 15 cm<sup>2</sup>.

## 20.
::: problem id=20_1 marks=1
Simon eats three equal-sized bowls of porridge, one after the other.  

When he has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, what fraction of the porridge in the second bowl has he eaten?  

* [x] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/9`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `2/15`
{.col-5}

---

Let the amount of porridge in each bowl be _p_.  

Then, when Simon has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, he has eaten
`4/9 × 3p = 4p/3 = p + p/3`, so he has eaten `1/3` of the second bowl.
