# Parallel Academy Year 8 Autumn Term Christmas Assignment

This week's homework is a little different to usual. You are required to answer a single problem and produce a full written solution (earning up to 5 marks).  

You will need to upload your solution and we will mark it and share personalised feedback over the next few weeks.

You can access the problem and upload your work via the following Google Form:
