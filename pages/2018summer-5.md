This is the fifth of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. The answer sheet (with explanations) will appear as soon as you hit the submit button.

Which of these diagrams could be drawn without taking the pen off the page and without
drawing along a line already drawn?

* [ ] A ![](/resources/2018summer-5/1-answer-1.gif)
* [ ] B ![](/resources/2018summer-5/1-answer-2.gif)
* [ ] C ![](/resources/2018summer-5/1-answer-3.gif)
* [ ] D ![](/resources/2018summer-5/1-answer-4.gif)
* [x] E ![](/resources/2018summer-5/1-answer-5.gif)
{.col-5}

---
For it to be possible to draw a figure without taking the pen off the paper and without drawing along an existing line, there must be at most two points in the figure at which an odd number of lines meet.

Only E satisfies this condition.

At Spuds-R-Us, a 2.5kg bag of potatoes costs £1.25. How much would one tonne of potatoes cost?

* [ ] £5
* [ ] £20
* [ ] £50
* [ ] £200
* [x] £500
{.col-5}

---

The cost of 1 kg of potatoes is `£1.25 ÷ 2.5 = 50p`. So the cost of 1 tonne,
that is 1000 kg, is `1000 × 50p = £500`.

The shape on the right is made up of three rectangles, each measuring 3cm by 1cm. What is
the perimeter of the shape?

* [x] 16 cm
* [ ] 18 cm
* [ ] 20 cm
* [ ] 24 cm
* [ ] More information needed

From the diagram, in which all lengths are in cm, it can be seen that the perimeter  
= `[4 × 1 + 3 × 3 + x + (3 - x)]` cm  
= 16 cm.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
In 1833 a ship arrived in Calcutta with 120 tons remaining of its cargo of ice. One third of the original cargo was lost because it had melted on the voyage. How many tons of ice was
the ship carrying when it set sail?

* [ ] 40
* [ ] 80
* [ ] 120
* [ ] 150
* [x] 180
{.col-5}

---

The 120 tons of ice which remain represent two-thirds of the original cargo.  

So one-third of the original cargo was 60 tons, and the original cargo was therefore 180 tons.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
A solid wooden cube is painted blue on the outside. The cube is then cut into eight smaller
cubes of equal size. What fraction of the total surface area of these new cubes is blue?

* [ ] `1/8`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [x] `1/2`
* [ ] `3/4`
{.col-5}

---

As the original cube was divided into eight cubes of equal size, these smaller cubes have side equal to half the side of the original cube.

So each of the new cubes originally occupied one corner of the large cube and hence has three faces painted blue and three faces unpainted.

So the fraction of the total surface area of the new cubes which is blue equals one half.

In this _Multiplication Magic Square_, the product of the three numbers in each row, each column and each of the diagonals is 1.

What is the value of `r + s`?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `9/16`
* [ ] `5/4`
* [ ] `33/16`
* [ ] 24

---
Consider the leading diagonal: `p × 1 × 18 = 1` so `p = 8`.  

Consider the bottom row: `u × 4 × 18 = 1` so `u = 2`.  

Consider the left-hand column: `p × s × u = 8 × s × 2 = 1` so `s = 1/16`.  

Consider the non-leading diagonal: `r × 1 × u = r × 1 × 2 = 1` so `r = 1/2`.

Therefore `r + s = 1/2 + 1/16 = 9/16`.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=2
If all the whole numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive are written down, which digit appears the
smallest number of times?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 9
* [ ] None: no single digit appears fewer times than all the others

---
Consider the nine numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive: each digit appears once, with the exception of zero. Now consider the 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99 inclusive: each of the 10 digits makes the same number of appearances (9) as the second digit of a number and the digits from 1 to 9 make an equal number of appearances (10) as the first digit of a number, but zero never
appears as a first digit.

There is a similar pattern in the 900 three-digit numbers from 100 to 999 inclusive with zero never appearing as a first digit, but making the same number of appearances as second or third digit as the other nine digits.

This leaves only the number 1000 in which there are more zeros than any other digit, but not enough to make up for the fact that zero appears far fewer times than the other nine digits in the numbers less than 1000.

It is left to the reader to check that 0 appears 192 times, 1 appears 301 times and each of 2 to 9 appears 300 times.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
In a 7-digit numerical code each group of four adjacent digits adds to 16 and each group of
five adjacent digits adds to 19. What is the sum of all seven digits?

* [ ] 21
* [x] 25
* [ ] 28
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 35
{.col-5}

---
Let the 7-digit code be `abcdefg`. It may be deduced that `a = 3` since `b + c + d + e = 16` and `a + b + c + d + e = 19`.

By using similar reasoning, it may be deduced that `b = c = e = f = g = 3`.

As `a + b + c + d = 16`, `d = 7`; so the code is `3337333`.

And that’s the end of the fifth Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
