# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 3_ A flag of flags

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

__Origin__: late 16th century: from French parallélogramme, via late Latin from Greek parallēlogrammon, from parallēlos ‘alongside another’ + grammē ‘line’.  

1. a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.
2. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
   mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
   young mathematicians.

Welcome to our latest Parallelogram designed for Year 8 students, a collection
of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons
more squiggly.

*	Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
*	But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
*	Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	 Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
*	Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in six parts.

__IMPORTANT__ – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct
 answer).

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	Five bets you will always win against your teacher

Here are five puzzles, riddles, challenges or brain-busters designed to baffle
the world's greatest brains, including your teachers.

As each problem is posed, pause the video and see if you can find a solution.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (8)

Some of you may have already taken part in the Junior Maths Challenge, and
others might be taking part this year for the first time. Either way, each
Parallelogram usually contains one or two Junior Maths Challenge questions to
help you prepare for the challenge day. These questions are excellent because
they encourage you to think in a more creative way, and with practice you might
achieve a bronze, silver or gold certificate.

(If you are not taking part in the Junior Maths Challenge, then it does not
matter – these questions are still great for developing your mathematical
skills.)

__2.1.__ A square is divided into three congruent rectangles. The middle rectangle is removed and replaced on the side of the original square to form an octagon as shown.

What is the ratio of the length of the perimeter of the square to the length of the perimeter of the octagon?

* [x] 3:5
* [ ] 2:3
* [ ] 5:8
* [ ] 1:2
* [ ] 1:1

Suppose that the square has side length 3d. Then the square has perimeter of length 4 x 3d = 12d.

Each rectangle has size 3d x d. So we see that the octagon has a perimeter length:

4d + 3d + 4d + d + 3d + d + 3d + d = 20d

Hence ratio of the lengths is 12d:20d = 3:5

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (9)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__  What is the smallest possible difference between two different 9-digit integers, each of which includes all the digits 1 to 9?

* [x] 9
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 27
* [ ] 36
* [ ] 45
{.col-5}

---

Let x and y be two different numbers each made up of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, with x > y . To make x - y as small as possible, it would be best if they differed just in the units digit, but, clearly, this is not possible. So we aim to find x and y which are the same except for their tens and units digits. These could be 21 and 12, for example with x = 987654321 and y = 987654312. This gives x-y=9.

Can we do any better? We now use the fact we've seen before, that the remainder when a positive integer is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of its digits is divisible by 9, to show we cannot get a smaller difference.

As x and y are made up of the same digits which add up to 45, they have the remainder 0 when we divide them by 9. So x - y also has remainder 0 when we divide by 9. So, as x ≠ y , 9 is the least possible value for x - y .

## 4. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (9e)

What is the largest difference between two 9-digit integers whose digits use each of the digits 1 to 9 once and once only? Once you've worked it out, fill in the larger number, the smaller number, and the difference between them, below:

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
__4.1__ Larger number:

<input type="number" solution="987654321"/>  
:::

::: problem id=4_2 marks=1
__4.2__ Smaller number:

<input type="number" solution="123456789"/>  
:::

::: problem id=4_3 marks=1
__4.3__ Difference between them:

<input type="number" solution="864197532"/>  

---

Now we have the opposite problem, so we want the biggest difference in the
“hundreds of millions column”, so let’s have 9--------- and 1--------. Then we
want the next biggest difference in the tens of millions column, so let’s have
98------- and 12-------. And so on, until we have 987,654,321 and 123,456,789,
so the difference is 864,197,532.

## 5. Flag of flags

It turns out that the country with the flaggiest flag is Norway. By ‘flaggiest’, I mean that it contains the flags of six other countries. For example, here is the flag of Thailand.

Next, here is the flag of Norway with a black rectangle showing how it contains the flag of Thailand.

Spot the five other flags. If you are not a vexillologist (an expert in flags), then [you might to check this page to see what the different flags look like](https://photius.com/flags/alphabetic_list.html){target="_blank"}.

## 6. Abbott & Costello - Loan Me 50 cents

Last week’s Parallelogram had some disturbing arithmetic courtesy of Lou
Costello, one of America’s most famous comedians. Here he is again, this time
being conned by his partner Bud Abbott. Abbott and Costello are one of
America’s most famous comedy double-acts.

Listen carefully and see if you can work out why the maths is fundamentally
wrong, and how Abbot is conning Costello. It might help to know that "dime" is
the nickname for a 10 cents coin. Also, answer the question below.

(BTW, visit the Find Out More section below for a link to the most famous and
funniest of all the sketches by Abbott and Costello.)

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1__ Abbott says that 40 + 10 = 50, but Costello says that can’t be right because:

* [ ] 15 + 35 = 50
* [ ] 20 + 30 = 50
* [x] 25 + 25 = 50
* [ ] 27 + 23 = 50
* [ ]  5 +  0 = 50

:::

Well done on completing this week’s Parallelogram. Check your email or return
to the website on Friday for the next one.

In the meantime, you can find the answers and go through the answer sheet after
7pm on Sunday. This is really important. Seriously important. What you got
right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went
wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something knew.

First... Remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, so that we can mark your
answers.

Also, once you have hit the SUBMIT button there will an extra bit of optional
Parallelogram if you are feeling particularly keen.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Further Stuff

Here is the most famous sketch by Abbott and Costello – “Who’s on first?” –
watch and enjoy:

This is a video presented by James Grime for the Numberphile channel. It is all
about the world’s most mathematical flag:

You can find lots of other Numberphile video by just googling – Numberphile
means “someone who loves numbers”, so if you love maths then it is the channel
for you.
