# If You’re Worried, Speak Up!

Sometimes you might be worried that the maths on this website is too difficult or too easy. That’s perfectly normal. However, sometimes your worries might be more serious. You might have what is known as a safeguarding concern.  



## 💬 What Is a Safeguarding Concern?  

It means:  
* You feel **unsafe**, **unhappy**, or **worried**  
* Someone is **hurting you**, **being mean**, or **making you uncomfortable**  
* You’re **worried about a friend** who might be in trouble  

No problem is too small. If something doesn’t feel right, it’s okay to tell someone.


## 👥 Who Can You Talk To?  

You can speak to:  
* a **trusted adult** (like your parent, carer, teacher)
* the **safeguarding lead** at Parallel if you feel unsafe using the Parallel website or taking part in any of our activities (email [safeguarding@parallel.org.uk](mailto:safeguarding@parallel.org.uk))
* **Childline** – 0800 1111 – Free, private, and open all day and night
* **NSPCC** – 0808 800 5000 – For you or someone you’re worried about


## 🗣️ What Can You Say?  

You can say something like:  
* “I feel worried about something.”  
* “Something happened and I don’t know what to do.”  
* “My friend is upset and I think they need help.”  
* “Can I tell you something that’s been bothering me?”  

You don’t need to have all the words. You just need to start talking.


## 📣 It’s OK to Talk  

* You **won’t get in trouble**  
* You will be **listened to**  
* If someone is in danger, the person you talk to may need to tell someone who can help—but they should always try to explain what's happening


## 🧾 A Reminder  

* You're **never too young** to ask for help.  
* If something feels **wrong**, **scary**, or **confusing**, speak up.
* The main thing is to **help keep you and others safe**.
