# Parallel for Parents

We have designed the Parallel website to help students expand their mathematical horizons beyond the school curriculum and to stretch their ambitions.  

The site is currently aimed at 11- to 16-year olds, but younger students might benefit if they are confident mathematicians and if you are able to occasionally give them a helping hand. Moreover, older students will find some interesting problems and topics. In short, everyone is welcome.  

What is the best way to use the website?  

*	Students should sign up and create a free account (everything is free).  
*	We issue a new Parallelogram each Thursday at 3pm (UK TIme), and students are encouraged to complete it before the next Parallelogram is released the following Thursday.  
*	The Parallelogram is marked and the score is returned to the student, along with access to the answer sheet, which includes full solutions. Going through the answer sheet is probably even more important than going through the question sheet.  
*	We currently have five streams of Parallelograms:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Year 7 students (for 11/12-year-olds).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Year 8 students (for 12/13-year-olds).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Year 9 students (for 13/14-year-olds).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Year 10 students (for 14/15-year-olds).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Year 11 students (for 15/16-year-olds).  
*	Your child will be assigned to one of the streams according to their age or year group, with younger children being assigned to the Year 7 stream, and older students being assigned to the Year 11 stream.  
*	If your child is in Year 6 or below, then they will benefit from following the Year 7 Parallelograms, as long as you are able to sit with them and guide them through any material that might be too challenging.  
*	Crucially, please stress to your child that getting answers wrong does not matter – it is an opportunity to learn something. Moreover, the Parallelograms are designed to include new and challenging material, and we would not be doing our job if every student was getting 100%.

Ps. Before I sign off, you might wonder who is writing this message. When I was a kid, I loved maths. I definitely wasn’t the best in the class and I often found maths hard, but I always enjoyed the challenge. Determination was the key.  

My parents grew up in India in the 1930s and did not have a proper education (and my mum still can’t read or write), so they were both very keen that I made the best of my time at school … and sure enough I left school and earned a place to study physics at Imperial College in London, and then I went to Cambridge University and CERN and completed a doctorate (a PhD) in particle physics. We were messing around with antimatter, bosons and quarks – all very exciting. Since then, I have written books and presented radio/TV programmes about maths/science, and now I am creating the Parallel universe for students who love maths and who want to work towards a future in science, technology, engineering, computing, economics or mathematics.
