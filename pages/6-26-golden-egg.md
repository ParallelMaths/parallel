*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. How do you like your eggs?

Egg shapes might seem a little wobbly and weird, and not at all what geometry is about!  

Watch this video where Johnny Ball transforms a pentagon into a perfect egg shape, using nothing but a straightedge and compass.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Which famous mathematician had a cult which explored the geometry of the pentagram?

* [ ] Uomo Delle Uova
* [ ] Pentagoras
* [x] Pythagoras

__1.2__ The ratio between the edge and the diagonal of a pentagon is very interesting mathematically, and crops up in many places - it is called the Golden Ratio.

Calculate the Golden Ratio to 3 decimal places.

__1.3__ The diagram shows a regular pentagon with two of its diagonals.  

If all the diagonals are drawn in, into how many areas will the pentagon be divided?

## 2. Puzzles

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Wendy The Wizard was making a magic potion by mixing 350ml of spit with 150ml of venom.  

How much more venom would need to be added to achieve a ratio of spit to venom of 7:4?

* [ ] 25ml
* [x] 50ml
* [ ] 100ml
* [ ] 150ml
* [ ] 200ml
{.col-5}

---

Starting with the ratio 7:4 we can multiply both sides by 50.  

Scaling up the ratio would give us 350:200.  

Meaning for 350ml of spit we would need 200ml of venom to achieve the correct ratio.  

Since we already have 150ml, we only need to add 50ml more!

::: problem id=2_2 marks=3
__2.2__ The diagram shows a regular hexagon with an equilateral triangle inside it.  

What is the size of the angle marked?

![](/resources/6-26-golden-egg/1-egg-diagram-2.png){image align="center"}

* [ ] 12°
* [ ] 15°
* [ ] 20°
* [x] 30°
* [ ] 60°
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
Two useful facts:  
* The angles at each vertex in an equilateral triangle are 60°
* The angles at each vertex in a regular hexagon are 120°
^^^
---

The vertex of the hexagon is 120°.   

If we subtract the 60° taken up by the triangle vertex we are left with 60°.  

This accounts for two of the marked angle, so by halfing we can conclude the marked angle is 30°.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
