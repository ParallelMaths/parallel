__1.1__ Four congruent isosceles trapeziums are placed so that their longer parallel sides form the diagonals of a square PQRS as shown.  

The point `X` divides `PQ` in the ratio 3:1.  

What fraction of the square is shaded?

* [ ] `5/6`
* [x] `3/8`
* [ ] `7/16`
* [ ] `5/12`
* [ ] `1/2`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=1_1
Since `X` divides `PQ` in the ratio 3:1, it is convenient to choose units so that the side of the square has length 4, and hence XQ has length 1. Then the total area of the square is `4^2 = 16`.

^^^ hint id=1_2

If we add the dotted lines to the diagram, as shown on the right, we see that the unshaded part of the square is made up of 4 isosceles right-angled triangles in which the shorter sides have length 2, and 4 isosceles right-angled triangles in which the shorter sides have length 1.

Each of the larger of these triangles has area `1/2 (2^2) = 2`, and
each of the smaller triangles has area `1/2 (1^2) = 1`. Therefore the total area of the square that is not shaded is `4 × 2 + 4 × 1/2 = 10`.  

Therefore the area that is shaded is `16 − 10 = 6`. Hence the fraction of the square that is shaded is `6/16 = 3/8`.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ Which of the following has the greatest value?

* [ ] `(11/7)^3`
* [ ] `(5/3)^3`
* [ ] `(7/4)^3`
* [x] `(9/5)^3`
* [ ] `(3/2)^3`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1
The fact that each bracket is cubed is a distraction. If A is bigger than `B`, and if `A` is bigger than 1, then `A^3` is bigger than `B^3`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2_2
There are several approaches, but one way is to make every fraction have the same denominator, e.g., 420.
^^^

If `x` and `y` are positive numbers, then `x < y` if and only if `x^3 < y^3`. So to determine which of the given fractions when cubed results in the largest number, we need only decide which of the fractions is the largest.  

To do this we use the fact that, where `p`, `q`, `r` and `s` are positive integers, we have `p/q < r/s ⇔ ps < rq`, and so we can compare the size of the fractions `p/q` and `r/s` by comparing the size of the integers `ps` and `qr`.  

Since `11 × 3 < 5 × 7`, `11/7 < 5/3`, and since `5 × 4 < 7 × 3`, `5/3 < 7/4`.  

Also `3 × 5 < 9 × 2` and so `3/2 < 9/5`. Hence the largest fraction is either `7/4` or `9/5`. Since `7 × 5 < 9 × 4`, `7/4 < 9/5`, and therefore `9/5` is the largest of the given fractions.  

We deduce that `(9/5)^3` is the largest of the given cubes.

## 3. QI Mathematics

If you watch QI on BBC2, then you will know that it is full of quite interesting things, including maths. This video is a compilation of some of the interesting maths that has been featured in the programme. Watch carefully, and then answer the questions below.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
__3.1__ Let’s look at McNugget numbers. McNuggets come in boxes of 6, 9 and 20. The biggest number of nuggets that cannot be made from combinations of 6, 9 and 20 is 43 nuggets, as mentioned in the video. But can you buy 37 nuggets?

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ Can you buy 38 nuggets?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

---

38 = 20 + 9 x 2 or 20 + 6 x 3.
:::

::: problem id=3_3 marks=1
__3.3__ Can you buy 39 nuggets?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

---

39 = 6 x 5 + 9.
:::

::: problem id=3_4 marks=1
__3.4__ Can you buy 40 nuggets?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

---

40 = 20 + 20.
:::

::: problem id=3_5 marks=1
__3.5__ Can you buy 41 nuggets?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

---

41 = 20 + 9 + 2 x 6.
:::

::: problem id=3_6 marks=1
__3.6__ Can you buy 42 nuggets?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

---

42 = 6 x 7.

::: problem id=3_7 marks=1
__3.7__ What is the surname of the philosopher mentioned in the QI clip who proved that 1 + 1 = 2? It contains 7 letters.

<input type="text" solution="RUSSELL"/>  
:::

::: problem id=3_8 marks=2
__3.8__ Pick a 3-digit number (with different digits), then create a new 3-digit number by reversing the digits. Take the smaller 3-digit number from the bigger 3-digit number to create a third 3-digit number (which we’ll call the “difference number”). Now reverse the digits of the “difference number” and add the result to the “difference number” – what is the result?  

(The result should be same whatever you decide to chose for your first 3-digit number. Think about why this might be.)

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
__4.1.__ In 1984 the engineer and prolific prime-finder Harvey Dubner found the biggest known prime each of whose digits is either a one or a zero.  

The prime can be expressed as `(10^641 × (10^640 −1))/9 + 1`.  

How many digits does this prime have?

* [ ] 640
* [ ] 641
* [ ] 1280
* [x] 1281
* [ ] 640 × 641
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1
The answer is odd.
^^^

---

The number `10^640 − 1` consists of a string of 640 nines when written out in standard form. So the number `10^641 × (10^640 - 1)` consists of a string of 640 nines followed by 641 zeros.  

Therefore `(10^641 × (10^640 - 1))/9` consists of a string of 640 ones followed by 641 zeros. Adding 1 just changes the final digit from zero to a one.  

So the prime is:

and therefore we see that it has 640 + 640 + 1 = 1281 digits.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
