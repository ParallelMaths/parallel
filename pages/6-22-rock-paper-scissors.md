*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## Who needs luck when you have maths?

Being a mathematician gives you superpowers, like having a slight advantage at Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS).  

Watch this video where Dr. Hannah Fry uses a mix of human psychology and probability to give you the competitive edge at this game of chance.  

We trust you to use this power wisely.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ If you have just lost a game of RPS, what is the best strategy to win the next game?

* [ ] Play the same move again
* [ ] Play the move they just played
* [x] Play the move which didn’t come up in the last round
* [ ] Choose rock. Rock always wins.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ If you have just won a game, what is the best strategy to win the next game?

* [ ] Play the same move again
* [x] Play the move they just played
* [ ] Play the move which would have beaten your last move
* [ ] Quit while you’re ahead!

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ When played randomly, what is the probability that a round will end in a draw?

* [ ] `1/2` 
* [x] `1/3` 
* [ ] `2/3`
* [ ] `1/9`
{.col-5}
 
---

3 out of the 9 possible games will end in a draw - so the probability of a draw is `1/3` when simplified.

## 2. Nice dice

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ An unusual die has its six faces labelled 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.  

If two such dice are rolled, and the numbers rolled added together, then how many different sums are possible?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 36
* [x] 14
{.col-5}

---
From all of these possible dice roll combinations we can create 14 possible totals: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 18.  

It is not possible to roll a 13, 15, or 17.

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ What is the most likely result when rolling and adding two of these dice?

* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [x] 10
* [ ] All possibilities are equally likely
{.col-5}

---

5 pairs five a total of 10, while all the other totals are made from only three or fewer pairs.  

This makes 10 the most likely total when rolling these dice.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
