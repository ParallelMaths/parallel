# Year 9 Summer Term Synoptic Paper

The purpose of this assignment is for you to review the session materials for one of our previous Year 9 modules, which will help to prepare you for more advanced modules in the Autumn.  

There are 20 questions, some of which you will be able to solve right away and some of which you are likely to find tricky.  

At the bottom of these instructions you will find links to PDFs of the session materials for this module. You should take the time to read through these **thoroughly** and you will find that the first 15 problems are similar to ones in the materials (the final 5 problems are a random mix of interesting problems that you should also attempt).  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown.  

**Do not rush this assignment!** Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck.  

**You have until the end of August 31st to submit this assignment. Only submit once you have had a proper go at the questions (and have read through the session materials).**  

**After you click Submit, you will not be able to un-submit.** You will then see your score and should examine which questions you got right and wrong.
