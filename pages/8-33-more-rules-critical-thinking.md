## 1. Digital clock symmetry

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ This time on a 24-hour clock has mirror symmetry:

![](/resources/8-33-more-rules-critical-thinking/1-symmetry.png){image align="center"}

Of the following options, how many minutes later will there also be a time with mirror symmetry?

* [ ] 404
* [ ] 414
* [ ] 424
* [x] 434
* [ ] 444
{.col-5}

---

434 minutes is 7 hours and 14 minutes later, which 20.05, which has mirror symmetry.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2018 (14) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ Billy has three times as many llamas as lambs. Milly has twice as many lambs as llamas.  

They have 17 animals in total.  

How many of the animals are llamas?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1
Suppose that Billy has `b` lambs and hence `3b` llamas. Then, in total, Billy has `4b` animals.  

Suppose that Milly has `m` llamas and hence `2m` lambs. Then, in total, Milly has `3m` animals.  

Because the total number of animals is 17, we have `4b + 3m = 17`.

Suppose that Billy has `b` lambs and hence `3b` llamas. Then, in total, Billy has `4b` animals.  

Suppose that Milly has `m` llamas and hence `2m` lambs. Then, in total, Milly has `3m` animals.  

Because the total number of animals is 17, we have `4b + 3m = 17`.

We have two unknowns but just one equation. This equation has infinitely many different solutions. However, in this problem `b` and `m` are numbers of animals, and so each of them is a non-negative integer. This enables us to find their values.  

Here `b` and `m` are non-negative integers. It follows that `4b ≤ 17` and hence `b ≤ 4`. So the only possible values for `b` are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  

It is easy to check that, of these values of `b`, only when `b = 2` is the corresponding value of `m` an integer.  

When `b = 2`, we have  

`4 × 2 + 3m = 17`,  

that is,  

`8 + 3m = 17`,  

and hence  

`3m = 9`,  

from which it follows that  

`m = 3`.  

Since `b = 2`, Billy has `3 × 2 = 6` llamas. Since `m = 3`, Milly has 3 llamas.  

Therefore `6 + 3 = 9` of the animals are llamas.

## 3. More integer solutions

`a` and `b` are positive integers and `7a + 5b = 49`. Find the values of `a` and `b`.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
__3.1__ What is a?  

<input solution="2"/>
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=1
__3.2__ What is b?  

<input solution="7"/>

---

It is tempting to jump to the solution that `a = 7` and `b = 0`, but 0 is not a positive solution.  

Instead, you can remove 7s from 49 until you reach a number that is divisible by 5.  

49 minus two 7s is 35.  

So the answer is `a = 2` and `b = 7`.
:::

`a` and `b` are positive integers and `23a + 17b = 320`. Find the values of `a` and `b`.

::: problem id=3_3 marks=1
__3.3__ What is `a`?  

<input solution="8"/>
:::

::: problem id=3_4 marks=1
__3.4__ What is `b`?  

<input solution="8"/>

---

Simply try different values for `a` and check to see if there is a value for `b` that is a positive integer.  

If `a = 1`, then `b = 17.5`ish, so that is not correct.  

But if `a = 8`, then `b = 8`, and that is correct.

Alternatively, you might notice that `23 + 17 = 40`, and that `320 = 40 × 8 = (23 + 17) × 8  = 23 × 8 + 17 × 8`.

## 4. Bertrand Russell’s rules for critical thinking

As mentioned last week, Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a British philosopher and mathematician. He compiled 10 rules for critical thinking (which is the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding the logical connection between ideas). In his words: _“The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate (promote).”_

The first five rules appeared last week… and here are the remaining five rules. Take a look at each rule, and think about why each one is important.

![](/resources/8-33-more-rules-critical-thinking/5-bertrand-russell.jpg){image align="right"}
_6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.  
7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.  
8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.  
9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.  
10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness._

__3.1__ What is the explanation for the missing square?

There is a full explanation of the problem at [the Mind Your Decisions blog](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/05/13/the-missing-square-problem/#.VULLz_lVhBc){target="_blank"}. Alternatively, this short video also gives a good explanation for the paradox.  

In case you don’t know what a paradox is, it is a statement that appears to rely on solid reasoning and logic, but which results in nonsense or a contradiction.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
