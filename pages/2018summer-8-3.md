# Year 8: Summer Problems #3

__Noun__: Parallelogram

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the third of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. The answer sheet (with explanations) will appear as soon as you hit the submit button.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
Which of the following is correct?

* [ ] 0 × 9 + 9 × 0 = 9
* [ ] 1 × 8 + 8 × 1 = 18
* [ ] 2 × 7 + 7 × 2 = 27
* [x] 3 × 6 + 6 × 3 = 36
* [ ] 4 × 5 + 5 × 4 = 45

---

The values of the left-hand sides of the expressions are 0, 16, 28, 36 and 40 respectively.

Each square in the figure is 1 unit by 1 unit.

What is the area of triangle ABM (in square units)?

* [ ] 4
* [x] 4.5
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 5.5
* [ ] 6

---

Triangle `ABM` has base 3 units and height 3 units, so its area is `1/2 × 3 × 3` units², that is `4 1/2` units².

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
How many different digits appear when `20/11` is written as a recurring decimal?

* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6

---

`20/11 = 1 9/11 = 1.818181...`, so only two different digits appear.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Gill is 21 this year. At the famous visit to the clinic in 1988, her weight was calculated to
be 5kg, but she now weighs 50kg.

What has been the percentage increase in Gill's weight
from 1988 to 2009?

* [x] 900%
* [ ] 1000%
* [ ] 5000%
* [ ] 9000%
* [ ] 10,000%
{.col-5}

---

The increase in Gill's weight is 45 kg, which is 9 times her weight in 1988.

So the percentage increase in weight is 900%.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
In Matt’s pocket there are 8 watermelon jellybeans, 4 vanilla jellybeans and 4 butter popcorn jellybeans.

What is the smallest number of jellybeans he must take out of his pocket to be certain that he takes at least one of each flavour?

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [x] 13
{.col-5}

---

If Matt takes 12 jellybeans then he will have taken at least one of each flavour unless he takes all 8 watermelon jellybeans and either all 4 vanilla jellybeans or all 4 butter popcorn jellybeans.

In this case the 4 remaining jellybeans will all be of the flavour he has yet to take, so taking one more jellybean ensures that he will have taken at least one of each flavour.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
Six friends are having dinner together in their local restaurant. The first eats there every day, the second eats there every other day, the third eats there every third day, the fourth eats there every fourth day, the fifth eats there every fifth day and the sixth eats there every sixth day.

They agree to have a party the next time they all eat together there. In how many days' time is the party?

* [ ] 30 days
* [x] 60 days
* [ ] 90 days
* [ ] 120 days
* [ ] 360 days

---

The lowest common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is required. Of these numbers, 2, 3 and 5 are prime whilst 4 = 2² and 6 = 2 × 3.

So their lowest common multiple is 2² × 3 × 5, that is 60.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
A rectangular sheet of paper is divided into two pieces by a single straight cut. One of the pieces is then further divided into two, also by a single straight cut.

Which of the following could _not_ be the total number of edges of the resulting three pieces?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 12
* [x] 13
{.col-5}

---

The diagrams below show how the total number of edges of the resulting three pieces may be 9, 10, 11 or 12.

However, 12 is the maximum value of the total number of edges since the original number of edges is four and any subsequent cut adds a maximum of four edges (by dividing two existing edges and adding the new ‘cuts’).

The parallelogram `WXYZ` shown in the diagram on the right has been divided into nine smaller parallelograms. The perimeters, in centimetres, of four of the smaller parallelograms are shown.

The perimeter of `WXYZ` is 21 cm.

What is the perimeter of the shaded parallelogram?

* [ ] 5 cm
* [ ] 6 cm
* [x] 7 cm
* [ ] 8 cm
* [ ] 9 cm
{.col-5}

Let the lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` be as shown in the diagram.

Then the sum of the perimeters of the four labelled parallelograms is `2(a + e) + 2(b + d) + 2(b + f ) + 2(c + e) = 2 (a + b + c + d + e + f ) + 2 (b + e)` = perimeter of `WXYZ` + perimeter of shaded parallelogram.

So the perimeter of the shaded parallelogram is ((11 + 8 + 4 + 5) − 21) cm = 7 cm.

And that’s the end of the third Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
