## 1. Smilla’s Sense of Snow

First a book, then a movie, this is the story of Smilla, who grew up in Greenland and who has an incredible knowledge and feeling for snow and all its properties and secrets. Moving from Greenland to Denmark, she finds herself using her scientific and snowy background to explain a mysterious death. In this clip, she talks about the two things that are most important to her, snow and...

## 2. Swearing on Mumsnet

This graph made me smile. It shows the amount of swearing for different swear words appearing on the Brexit discussion pages on the social media site Mumsnet. I have removed the swear word labels, but you can probably guess some of them.  

You might wonder why there are certain peaks? They are probably linked to the initial referendum, the election of Mrs May, submitting Article 50, etc.  

The point of the this section is to look at the surprising things that people can plot.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ In 2019, there is a curious double spike for most of the swear words. Roughly, how many days apart are the two peaks?

* [ ] 30 days
* [x] 60 days  
* [ ] 90 days
* [ ] 100 days
* [ ] 120 days
{.col-5}

Each vertical line marks 6 months, or roughly 180 days. The space between the double peaks is about 1/3 of the distance between vertical lines, so we are looking at 1/3 x 180 days = roughly 60 days.

The diagram shows three rectangles.  

What is the value of `x`?

We let the angles in the triangle that is formed by the rectangles be `p°`, `q°` and `r°`, as shown in the figure.  

The angles of a rectangle are 90°, as shown. The angles on the line at the points where the bottom rectangle meets the other two are each 180°, as shown.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore, from the angles at the points where the rectangles meet, we have the following three equations.  

`p + 90 + 90 + x = 360`,  
`q + 180 + 90 + 43 = 360`, and  
`r + 180 + 90 + 29 = 360`.  

It follows that  

`p = 180 − x`,  
`q = 47`, and  
`r = 61`.  

Therefore, because the angles in a triangle total 180°,  

`(180 − x) + 47 + 61 = 180`,  

from which it follows that  

`180 − x + 108 = 180`,  

and hence `x = 108`.

In the diagram shown, `PQ = SQ = QR` and `∠SPQ = 2 × ∠RSQ`.  

What is the size of angle `QRS`?

We let `∠QRS = x°`. Because `SQ = QR`, the triangle `SQR` is isosceles. Therefore `∠RSQ = ∠QRS = x°`.  

Because `∠SPQ = 2 × ∠RSQ`, we deduce that `∠SPQ = 2x°`. Since `PQ = SQ`, the triangle `SPQ` is isosceles. Therefore `∠PSQ = ∠SPQ = 2x°`.  

It follows that `∠RSP = 2x° + x° = 3x°`.  

We now apply the fact that the angles of a triangle have sum 180° to the triangle `PRS`. This gives `x + 2x + 3x = 180`. Hence `6x = 180`. Therefore `x = 30`. It follows that `∠QRS` is 30°.

__5.1__ ![](/resources/10-18-smilla-sense-snow/5-circles.jpg){image align="right"}
The diagram shows seven circular arcs and a heptagon with equal sides but unequal angles.  

The sides of the heptagon have length 4.  

The centre of each arc is a vertex of the heptagon, and the ends of the arcs are the midpoints of the two adjacent sides.  

What is the total shaded area?

* [ ] 12π
* [ ] 14π
* [ ] 16π
* [x] 18π
* [ ] 20π
{.col-5}

---
The shaded area is made up of seven sectors of circles each of radius 2.  

The area of a circle with radius 2 is `π × 2^2 = 4π`.  

The area of a sector of a circle is directly proportional to the angle subtended by the sector at the centre of the circle. A full circle subtends an angle of 360° at its centre. Therefore, if the total of the angles subtended by the shaded sectors shown in the figure is `x × 360°`, the total shaded area is `x × 4π`.  

The internal angles of a polygon with `n` sides add up to `(n − 2) × 180°`. Therefore, the internal angles of a heptagon add up to `5 × 180°`.  

The total of the angles at a point is 360°. Therefore the total of the angles at the seven vertices of the heptagon is `7 × 360°`. Since the internal angles have total `5 × 180°`, the total of the external angles is `7 × 360° − 5 × 180° = 7 × 360° − 5/2 × 360° = 9/2 × 360°`.  

Therefore the total shaded area is `9/2 × 4π`, that is, `18π`.

## 6. Rob Eastaway’s puzzle

Rob Eastaway is the author of several great books about maths, and his most recent publication is “Maths on the Back of an Envelope: Clever ways to (roughly) calculate anything”.

__6.1__ Here is a puzzle that he recently published online.  

The numbers 1 to 9 have been written on cards and placed into two columns, like this:

![](/resources/10-18-smilla-sense-snow/6-columns.png){image align="center"}

Here's the puzzle: move just one card so that the two columns add to the same total.  

Rules:
1.	You cannot move one card so that it covers another card.
2.	You cannot turn a card over, so that the number is no longer visible.
3.	You cannot move a number to the top corner of another number, so that it becomes an exponential.

Which card do you move?

<input solution="9"/>

^^^ hint id=6_1 marks=1
Moving a card can mean sliding it, but it can also mean rotating it?
^^^

^^^ hint id=6_2 marks=1
If you find the correct solution, both columns will add to 21.
^^^

---

The right column sums to 21. If you rotate the 9 in left column, so it becomes a 6, it also sums to 21.
