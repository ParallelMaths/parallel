# Maths tutors - we need YOU! 

The Parallel Academy offers a genuinely life-changing opportunity for young people. Our goal is to increase the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians.  

The Parallel Academy supports ambitious students to achieve their mathematical potential by providing them with the opportunity to develop their reasoning and problem-solving skills beyond the curriculum. Students join in Year 7 and receive 30 free online tutorials. The overwhelming majority of students then continue until Year 11, putting them on a path to studying STEM at top universities.  

**We need more great tutors!**  

Last year, over 2,000 students applied to join our entirely free programme of weekly online tutoring. This year we expect twice as many brilliant students to apply. In order not to turn away students with both potential and enthusiasm, we need more tutors to join our mission, so we are currently recruiting.

If you are excited to join our team, and to work with small groups of highly capable and enthusiastic students, we would love to hear from you.  

We are looking for tutors who will:  
* be confident at explaining mathematics  
* be able to engage and inspire students of all ages,  
* have experience in online tutoring or classroom teaching,  
* have experience in teaching mathematics to at least GCSE level.  

We are particularly keen to hear from tutors who have experience of teaching A Level Maths and A Level Further Maths, as well as tutors who are comfortable preparing students for UKMT challenges.  

Tutors are paid Â£30 per 50-minute tutorial, and will be able to choose the days and times that work best for them.
