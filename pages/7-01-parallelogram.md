Welcome to the first of out Parallelograms designed for Year 7 students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons more squiggly.
You can start and stop whenever you like, but you should complete all the challenges by 7pm on Sunday, particularly if your teacher has asked to complete this Parallelogram.
You can return to the site any time after 7pm on Sunday and you will find your score and a sheet with answers and explanations… as long as you have completed the challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.
This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in seven parts… some Challenges will have a single theme, while others have sections that shoot off in wildly different directions. In short, these challenges are often going to be a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas.

1.	Secret codes
2.	More codes
3.	Wangle the angles
4.	A maths teacher’s age
5.	Dangerous physics
6.	An easy puzzle

<div class="warning">

**Instructions**
* You will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct answer).
* Some questions have a hint (sometimes two hints). Please think hard and try hard before resorting to the hint. The hints will help you get the right answer, but you will lose marks.
* It does not really matter what you score get, the main thing is that you think hard about the problems… and then learn where you went wrong when the answers appear.

## 1. Secret codes

Over the next few weeks, one of mathematical themes that we will be exploring is secret codes. How do you make a code and how do you break a code? The proper word for this **cryptography**, from the Greek words for *“secret”* and *“writing”*.

You might think that cryptography is all about language, because we are messing around with messages made of words. Actually, cryptography is 99% maths, and numbers at the heart of secrecy, particularly today in the age of the Internet. You might be surprised to know that some of the  biggest employers of mathematicians are the secret services in countries around the world. And, of course, big companies employ mathematician to protect their secrets (and maybe steal the secrets of rival companies).

The cryptography theme starts properly next week, but in the meantime here is a quick puzzle about a code just to warm you up.
Here is a 5x5 grid containing all the letters of the alphabet, except Z:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| F | G | H | I | J |
| K | L | M | N | O |
| P | Q | R | S | T |
| U | V | W | X | Y |

The word CODE is coded with the following series of symbols.

Try to work out how the code works.

**1.1 Which Star Wars character is represented by symbols below?**
::: problem
<div class="marks">2 marks</div>

If you are stuck then you can use the hint, but it will cost you 1 mark.		

HINT: The first symbol above represents C. It has one line on the left side, and three lines on the right side – in the grid, C appears in which row and column?

<img src="/images/challenges/7-1/1-2-question.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 1rem"/>

<div class="choice radio c5">
  <div x-radio="p_1_1, a" class="correct">Rey</div>
  <div x-radio="p_1_1, b">Han</div>
  <div x-radio="p_1_1, c">Rex</div>
  <div x-radio="p_1_1, d">Poe</div>
  <div x-radio="p_1_1, e">Maz</div>
</div>

<div class="solution">
By looking at the letters in CODE and the symbols that represent them, you should have noticed that the rule is “a letter is in row x and column y is represented with a symbol which has x branches on the left and y branches on the right”. So the answer is Rey.

Alternatively, you might have noticed that the symbol for E in CODE also appears as the second symbol of the mystery name, which narrows down the possible answers to Rey or Rex. However, to decide which is correct, you really need to have worked out the general rule that links rows/columns with branches on the left/right.

## 2. More codes

As one final teaser for the cryptography ahead, here is a trailer for the film The Imitation Game, released in 2014. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch playing the real-life codebreaker and mathematician Alan Turing, who cracked the German Enigma code in the Second World War. This true story shows how mathematicians can change history. We’ll be looking at Turing and the Enigma code in a few weeks time, but first take a look at this clip and answer the two questions. You will find one answer in the film, and the other answer you will have to Google (or you might know it).

## 3. Wangle the angles

**3.1 Look at the diagram below and wangle (obtain by some devious manner) the angles x and y.**
::: problem
<div class="marks">x marks</div>

The triangles A and B are both equilateral.

<img src="/images/challenges/7-1/3-1-angles.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 1rem"/>

Angle x = <input type="number" min="0" max="180" data-id="s3-q3.1"/> &deg;

Angle y = <input type="number" min="0" max="180" data-id="s3-q3.2"/> &deg;

<div class="solution">
<img src="/images/challenges/7-1/3-1-angles-answer.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 1rem"/>

First, you can fill in the six 60&deg; angles of the 2 equilateral triangles. Angle a1 is obvious (75&deg;), and so is angle a2 (80&deg;). Once you know a2, then a3 must be 35&deg;.

The rest is easy. Angle y must be (180 – a3 – 60)&deg; and angle x must be (360 – 60 – 60 – a1)&deg;.

## 4. A maths teacher’s age

A student asked her maths teacher if he would reveal his age. See an opportunity to test his student’s mental skills, the teacher replied with a riddle: “My age in years is not a prime but is odd. Also, when the digits in my age are reversed and the new number added to my age, the result is a perfect square. Of course, if you prefer, you can take my age and reverse the digits and subtract that from my age and still get a perfect square.”

Although 51 is odd and not a prime, the teacher cannot be 51 years old, because neither (51 + 15) nor (51 -15) are perfect squares, and they both need to be perfect squares.

**4 How old is the teacher?**
::: problem
<div class="marks">3 marks</div>

<input type="number"data-id="s4-q4"/>

There are two hints below in case you need them, but they will cost you marks.

::: hint 1
It might be reasonable to assume that the teacher is more than 20 and less than 80. Moreover, the age is odd but not a prime, so you can start by listing all the odd numbers and striking out the primes, so you have: 21, ~~23~~, 25, 27, ~~29~~, ~~31~~, 33, 35, ~~37~~, 39,…

::: hint 2
If the second digit in the age is larger than the first digit, then when you reverse the digits you will have a larger number and you will not be able to subtract the reversed age from the actual age. Hence, you cross out all those numbers AB where B is bigger than A, so you have the stikeouts from Hint 1, plus the ones shown: 21, _~~23~~_, _25_, _27_, _~~29~~_, ~~31~~, 33, _35_, _~~37~~_, _39_,…

<div class="solution">

If you test whatever is left over, then you will eventually realise that one possible answer is 65. It is odd, but not prime, and 65 + 56 = 121 = 11<sup>2</sup>, and 65 – 56 = 9 = 3<sup>2</sup>.

## 5. Dangerous physics

If you become a strong mathematician (which just requires lots of practice), then you will be well prepared to become a physicist, engineer or computer scientist. I think it is largely true to say that you cannot be a top class physicists, engineer or computer scientist unless your maths is strong.

Because of this link between maths and other subjects, we will occasionally explore this other subjects in our Parallelograms, and today I want to show you one of my favourite videos about physics.

 Walter Lewin is one the world’s best physics lecturers, and this is one of his most famous demonstrations. One of the laws of physics says that if you drop a ball then it cannot bounce higher than where you dropped it – imagine the consequences if the opposite was true – a ball would drop and bounce higher than its starting point, then fall and bounce even higher still, then fall and bounce higher still, and so on until the ball flew off into space. In short, objects tend to lose energy, often due to friction, so they never quite get back to their start position. This is also true of objects that swing back and forth, as demonstrated in the video below.

 @[youtube](xXXF2C-vrQE?rel=0)

 **4 There are different types of energy, and Professor Lewin says that the ball’s gravitational potential energy is transformed into:**

 ::: problem
 <div class="marks">3 marks</div>

 <div class="choice radio c5">
   <div x-radio="p_5_1, a">Chemical energy</div>
   <div x-radio="p_5_1, b" class="correct">Kinetic energy</div>
   <div x-radio="p_5_1, c">Elastic energy</div>
   <div x-radio="p_5_1, d">Solar energy</div>
   <div x-radio="p_5_1, e">Swing energy</div>
 </div>

 Perhaps the professor is exaggerating when he implies that the demonstration is potentially deadly, but there is no doubt that is dangerous, as demonstrated in the clip below. Before you laugh, bear in mind that the bright young student was brave and dedicated, but made just one small mistake, and paid a painful price.

  @[youtube](teqsNtYbJAY?rel=0)

 Why did this experiment go so badly wrong? The ball followed the laws of physics, and it swung forward, and then it swung all the way back, but very slightly short of where it started. The problem was that the student, after releasing the ball, moving forward a tiny amount. That tiny movement was bigger was enough to result in a painful lesson.


## 6. An easy puzzle
(½ mark/answer, 3½ in total)

I saw this in a newspaper – it was a puzzle for adults, fully grown humans, but I think you will find it easy. All the digits from 1 to 9 are used in this grid, but only once. Can you work out their positions in the grid so that each of the six different sums works? Two of the numbers have been inserted in order to get you started. Just identify the other seven numbers.

<img src="/images/challenges/7-1/6-1-puzzle.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 1rem"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
a = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.1"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
b = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.2"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
c = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.3"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
d = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.4"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
e = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.5"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
f = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.6"/>

::: problem
<div class="marks">1/2 mark</div>
g = <input type="number" data-id="s3-q6.7"/>


<div class="solution">
The easiest number to pin down is (d), which has to be 9.

5/1 x 9 = 45.

You may have followed a different route, but I then worked (c) and (g), because 9c + g must equal 67, and (c) and (g) are single digits then c = 7 and g = 4.

Now we know c = 7, then we also know that a x b = 48.

This means that a = 6 and b = 8 or a = 8 and b = 6.

We know that b + 1 is factor of 18 from the middle column, so b = 8.

We also know that a x 5 is a factor of 90 from the 1st column, so a = 6.

And the rest is easy.

I hope you enjoyed (or at least did not hate) your this Parallelogram, the first one of the 2018. There will be more next week, and the week after, and the week after that. So check your email or return to the website on Friday.

In the meantime, you can find the answers and go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday. This is really important. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something knew.

First …. Remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, so that we can mark your answers.

Also, once you have hit the SUBMIT button there will an extra bit of optional Parallelogram if you are feeling particularly keen.

Cheerio,
Simon.


## Further Stuff

If you want to find out more about codebreaker and mathematician Alan Turing, then [this BBC article] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-41696274 reveals what he was like as a school book. It contains his school report, recently displayed at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

Professor Lewin is a superstar and a hero of mine. He has dedicated his life to exploring physics and explaining it to the rest of the world. In the next clip he shows some of the weird behaviour of spinning objects. Behind the experiment is a blackboard full of mathematics, and these equations predict exactly the strange behaviour of the spinning wheel.

And in the second clip, the professor explains some very advanced ideas about the death of stars, black holes and marshmallows. Interestingly, some of the physics he discuss is the same as the physics need to describe the dangerous swinging ball demonstration. (Don’t worry if you only understand some of this video – just let the ideas blow your mind.)
