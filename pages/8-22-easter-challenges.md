## 1. 580-ton monster machine is building bridges across China

This machine is incredible. As you watch the video, look at when it moves the massive bridge sections forwards... what does it have to do before it can redistribute the weight?

## Junior Maths Challenge (UKMT) Mock

Some of you will be doing the UKMT’s Junior Maths Challenge next month, so the rest of this Parallelogram consists of 12 Junior Maths Challenge questions – some easy, some tricky. This is an opportunity to get some practice before the real JMC. And, if you are not doing the JMC, then it is an excellent way to develop your maths skills.

In the real JMC, you would have one hour to attempt 25 questions, so in theory you have roughly thirty minutes to complete these 13 questions. However, don’t rush, don’t guess and don’t worry if you need longer than thirty minutes … you might even need the full hour.

Here are a few things to bear in mind when you do the real JMC:
* the first half of the questions are not too tricky (__also true below__).
* the second half the questions are really tricky (__also true below__).
* you will lose marks for wrong answers in the second half of the questions (__not true below__).

So don’t take wild guesses for the second half of the questions in the real JMC, and don’t take wild guesses for trickier questions below. However, if you have a rough idea of the answer or have narrowed it down to a couple of possible answers, then it is worth picking an answer.

__We have tried to make our Parallelograms more printer-friendly. In general, it is better to answer questions online, but sometimes (and maybe this is one of those times) it might be worth printing out one or two of the questions, doing them on paper, and then entering your answers back on the screen. And make sure you have a paper and pencil to hand for sketches and calculations.__

Finally, afterwards, make sure you go through all the answers and see where you went right and where you went wrong. This is 100% the best way to improve your maths skills.

__The next Parallelogram will contain our usual mix of videos, humour, puzzles and problems.__


## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=5
__2.1__ What is the smallest four-digit positive integer which has four different digits?

* [ ] 1032
* [ ] 2012
* [ ] 1021
* [ ] 1234
* [x] 1023
{.col-5}

---

Here it is easy just to check the options that are given. A, D and E are the only options in which all four digits are different. Of these, clearly, E is the smallest.

For a complete solution we need to give an argument to show that 1023 really is the smallest four digit positive integer with four different digits. It is easy to do this.

To get the smallest possible number we must use the four smallest digits, 0, 1, 2 and 3. A four digit number cannot begin with a 0. So we must put the next smallest digit, 1, in the thousands place, as a four-digit number beginning with 2 or 3 is larger than one beginning with a 1. For similar reason the
hundreds digit must be the smallest remaining digit, 0. Similarly the tens digit must be 2 and the units digit must be 3.

So the required number is 1023.

__3.1__ Which of the following has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself?
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6; the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8; the factors of 13 are 1 and 13; the factors of 19 are 1 and 19; and the factors of 25 are 1, 5 and 25. We see from this that, of the numbers we are given as options, only 25 has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself. It is worth noticing that 25 is the only square number.

All you have to do is a subtraction: 2012 - 1850 = 162.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ A small ink cartridge has enough ink to print 600 pages. Three small cartridges can print as many pages as two medium cartridges. Three medium cartridges can print has many pages as two large cartridges. How many pages can be printed using a large cartridge?

* [ ] 1200
* [x] 1350
* [ ] 1800
* [ ] 2400
* [ ] 5400
{.col-5}

---

Three small cartridges have enough ink for `3 × 600 = 1800` pages. So 1800 is the number of pages that two medium cartridges can print. Hence one medium cartridge can print `1/2` (1800) = 900 pages. So three medium cartridges have enough ink for `3 × 900 = 2700` pages. So 2700 is the number of pages
that two large cartridges can print. Hence one large cartridge can print `1/2` (2700) = 1350 pages.

An alternative, algebraic method, is to let `m` be the number of pages that a medium cartridge can print, and `l` be the number of pages that a large cartridge can print. From the information we are given we
have the equations `3 × 600 = 2m` and `3m = 2l`.

From these we can deduce that `l` = `3/2` `m` = `3/2` `×` `(3 × 600)/2` `= 9 × 150 = 1350`.

__6.1__ The diagram on the right shows the positions of four people (each
marked `x`) in an Art Gallery. In the middle of the room is a stone
column. Ali can see none of the other three people. Bea can see only
Caz. Caz can see Bea and Dan. Dan can only see Caz.

Who is at position `p`?

The person in position `p` is the only one who can see two of the others.
We are told that Caz can see Bea and Dan but everyone else can see
just one other person or no-one. So it must be Caz who is at position `P`.

We can also see that Ali, who can see no-one, must be in the position
shown. Bea and Dan must be in the other two positions, but the
information we are given doesn't enable us to work out which is where.

## 7.

__7.1__ In the following expression each ▲ is to be replaced with either + or - in such a way that the result of the calculation is 100.

123 ▲ 45 ▲ 67 ▲ 89  
{.text-center}

The number of + signs used is `p` and the number of - signs used is `m`. What is the value of `p` - `m` ?

* [ ] -3

* [ ] 3
{.col-5}

---

One approach is trial and error, as there are only a few combinations. For example, if it is (+ 45) then it is hard to see how we obtain a result of 100. So, we can then explore (- 45). Following this approach quickly leads you to the correct answer, but there is also a more rigorous and mathematical approach.

The sum is made up of 123 and ± 45, ± 67and ± 89. Suppose that the total of the positive terms in the calculation is `x` and the total of the negative terms is `y`. So `x > 0` and `y < 0`. We need to have that:

`x + y = 100`.
{.text-center}

We also have that:

`x - y = 123 + 45 + 67 + 89 = 324`.
{.text-center}

Adding these equations, we obtain `2x = 424`. So `x = 212` and hence `y = -112`. It is readily seen that `45 + 67 = 112` and that no other combination of 45, 67 and 89 gives a total of 112. So the correct calculation must be `123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100` with 1 plus sign and 2 minus signs. So `p = 1` and
`m = 2`, giving `p - m = -1`.

__8.1__ In the multiplication grid on the right, the input factors (in the first row and the first column) are all missing and only some of the products within the table have been given.

What is the value of A + B + C + D + E ?

* [x] 161

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/9-grid-answer1.jpg){image align="right"}
Let the input factors be `p, q, r, s` and `t` along the top row, and `v, w, x, y` and `z` in the first column, as shown in the grid on the right.

We see that `wp = 15` and `xp = 18`, so that `p` is a divisor of both 15 and 18, and hence is either 1 or 3. However, if `p = 1`, then it would follow that `w = 15`. But this is not possible as `wr = 40`. We deduce that `p = 3`. It follows that `w = 5` and `x = 6`. Since `w = 5` and `wr = 40`, we have that `r = 8`.

Therefore, as `zr = 56`, `z = 7`. Also, as `x = 6` and `xs = 60`, `s = 10`. ![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/9-grid-answer2.jpg){image align="right"} Since `vs = 20`, it follows that `v = 2`. Then, as `vq = 10`, `q = 5`. Hence, as `yq = 20`, we have that `y = 4` . Finally, as `yt = 24`, we deduce that `t = 6`.

This enables us to complete the table, as shown on the left. (Though, really, we need only to calculate the diagonal entries that we have shown in bold.)

Therefore, we have `A + B + C + D + E = 6 = 25 + 48 + 40 + 42 = 161`.

__9.1__ Talulah plants 60 tulip bulbs. When they flower, she notes that half are yellow; one third of those which are not yellow are red; and one quarter of those which are neither yellow nor red are pink. The remainder are white.

What fraction of the tulips are white?

* [ ] `1/24`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `1/4`
{.col-5}

---

Since half the 60 bulbs are yellow, 30 are yellow and 30 are not yellow. One third of the 30 bulbs that are not yellow are red, So 10 are red and 20 are neither yellow nor red. One quarter of the 20 that are neither yellow nor red, are pink. So 5 bulbs are pink.

This leaves 15 bulbs which are neither yellow, nor red nor pink. So there are 15 white bulbs. Therefore the fraction of bulbs that are white is `15/60`, that is, `1/4`.

__10.1__ There are six more girls than boys in Miss Spelling's class of 24 pupils. What is the ratio of girls to boys in this class?

* [ ] 3:1
* [ ] 1:4
* [ ] 3:5
{.col-5}

---

Suppose there are `g` girls and `b` boys in Miss Spelling's class. As there are 6 more girls than boys, `g - b = 6`. As there are 24 pupils altogether, `g + b = 24`. Adding these equations gives `2g = 30`, so `g = 15`. Hence `b = 15 - 6 = 9`. So the ratio `g:b` is `15:9` which is the same as `5:3`.

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/12-rectangles-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
Let `∠QSR` `= x°`. Since `PS` is parallel to `QR`, the alternate angles `∠PQS` and `∠QSR` are equal. So `∠PQS` `= x°`. Therefore, as `∠PSQ`:`∠PQS` `= 1:5`, `∠PSQ` `= 1/5 x°`. Therefore, from the right angled triangle `PQS` we deduce that `x + 1/5 x + 90 = 180` and so `6/5 x = 90`. Therefore `x = 5/6 × 90 = 75`.

So `∠QSR` is 75°.

__12.1__ Dominic wants to place the six dominoes above in a hexagonal ring so that, for every pair of adjacent dominoes, the numbers of pips match. The ring on the right indicates how one adjacent pair match.

In a completed ring, how many of the other five dominoes can he definitely not place adjacent to ![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/13-dominoes-question3.jpg) ?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2

---

There are only two 1-pip dominoes among the six Dominic has. These must therefore be adjacent. Likewise for the two 2-pips, the two 6-pips and the two 4-pips. So the ring must include the three adjacent dominoes:

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/13-dominoes-answer1.jpg){image align="center"}

and also the three adjacent dominoes:

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/13-dominoes-answer2.jpg){image align="center"}

The ring may now be completed two ways, i.e., by connecting top-left 5-pip to bottom-left 5-pip and the top-right 5-pip to bottom-right 5-pip … or by connecting top-left 5-pip to bottom-right 5-pip and the top-right 5-pip to bottom-left 5-pip.

We therefore see that Dominic can create two different rings of six dominoes, as shown below.

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/13-dominoes-answer5.jpg){image align="center"}

We now see that there are just 2 dominoes that the [1:5] domino cannot be adjacent to, namely the domino [2:5] and, of course, the domino [4:6].

## 13.

::: problem id=13_1 marks=6
__13.1__ Peter wrote a list of all the numbers that could be produced by changing one digit of the number 200. How many of the numbers in Peter's list are prime?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

---

If the hundreds or tens digit of 200 is changed, but the units digit is unchanged, the resulting number is, like 200, a multiple of 10, and so cannot be prime. So we need only consider the 9 numbers that we can get by changing the units digit. Of these, we can see immediately that 202, 204, 206 and 208 are all divisible by 2 and 205 is divisible by 5. So none of them is prime.

This just leaves 201, 203, 207 and 209. Now:  
`201 = 3 × 67`,   
`203 = 7 × 29`,  
`207 = 3 × 3 × 23` and  
`209 = 11 × 19`.

None of them are prime, so none of the numbers in Peter's list are prime.

## 14.

![](/resources/8-09-easter-challenges/15-triangle-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__14.1__ The interior angles of a triangle are `(5x + 3y)`°, `(3x + 20)`° and `(10y + 30)`°, where `x`, `y` are positive integers.

What is the value of `x + y`?

* [x] 15
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 11

---

Crucially, the question said that x and y are positive __integers__.  

The angles of a triangle add up to 180°. So `(5x + 3y) + (3x + 20) + (10y + 30) = 180`. This gives `8x + 13y + 50 = 180`. Therefore `8x + 13y = 130`, and so

`8x = 130 - 13y = 13(10 - y)`.
{.text-center}

It follows that `8x` is a multiple of 13 and hence, as 8 and 13 have no common factors, it must be that `x` is a multiple of 13. So `x = 13a`, where `a` is a positive integer. It then follows that

`8(13a) = 13(10 - y)`
{.text-center}

and so, cancelling the factor 13

`8a = 10 - y`
{.text-center}

and hence `10 - y` is a positive number which is a multiple of 8. The only positive value of `y` for which `10 - y > 0` and `10 - y` is a multiple of 8, is `y = 2`, which gives `a = 1` and hence `x = 13`. So `x + y = 13 + 2 = 15`.
