On the left menu you will see the various Parallelograms.
*	The most recent Paralellogram is at the top, and is probably the one that you are looking for.
*	Past Parallelograms appear below the newest one.
*	NEW means that the Parallelogram has been released within the last few days and we’re waiting for you to tackle it.
*	A black square means you have completed the Parallelogram, but it has not yet been marked. Answers appear Sunday at 7pm.
*	A percentage means that you have completed the Parallelogram, and the score and answer sheet are available – just click.
*	Nothing next to the name means it’s a past Parallelogram that you have not yet tackled.
*	You can revisit old Parallelograms, but you cannot change your answers if you have already hit the SUBMIT button.
*	If you have completed all the Parallelograms, then the next Parallelogram will appear on Friday at 4pm.
