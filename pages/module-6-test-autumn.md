## 1.	
::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the highest common factor of `84` and `126`?  

<input solution="42"/>  

---

`84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7` and `126 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 7`.  
 
 
So the highest common factor is `2 × 3 × 7 = 42`.

## 2.
::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
What is angle `a`, in the diagram below?  

![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/2-quadrilateral.png){image align="center"}

<input solution="48"/>  

---

Angles in a quadrilateral sum to `360°`, so `a = 360  –  (117 + 99 + 96) = 48`.  

:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is `5:3` and there are `15` girls, how many students are there altogether?  

* [ ] `20`
* [ ] `25`
* [ ] `30`
* [ ] `35`
* [x] `40`
{.col-5}

---

`15` girls represent `3/(3 + 5) = 3/8` of the total number of students.  

So the total number of students is `8/3 × 15 = 40`.  

:::


## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is prime?  

* [ ] `111`
* [x] `113`
* [ ] `115`
* [ ] `117`
* [ ] `119`
{.col-5}

---

* `111 = 3 × 37`
* `113` is prime  
* `115 = 5 × 23`
* `117 = 9 × 13`
* `119 = 7 × 17`
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
What is the value of each interior angle of a regular octagon, in degrees?

<input solution="135"/>  

---

The general formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is:  

`180°  × (n − 2)/n`  

For an octagon, we substitute `n = 8` to get an interior angle of:  

`180°  × 6/8 = 180°  × 3/4 = 135°`  
:::


## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is largest?  

* [ ] `3^4`
* [x] `2^7`
* [ ] `8^2`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `9^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are  

* `3^4 = 81`
* `2^7 = 128`
* `8^2 = 64`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `9^2 = 81`  

:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What number must be added to the set `{3, 4, 5, 6}` to give a mean of `6`?  

* [ ] `4`
* [ ] `6`
* [ ] `8`
* [ ] `10`
* [x] `12`
{.col-5}

---

The total of all the numbers will be `5 × 6 = 30`.  

So the missing number is `30  -  (3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 12`.  

:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability that you get the same outcome all three times?  

* [ ] `1/8`
* [x] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `3/4`
* [ ] `1`
{.col-5}

---

There are two ways this could happen: three Heads or three Tails.  

p(3 Heads) = `1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`.  

Similarly, p(3 Tails) = `1/8`.  

So the probability of getting either of these outcomes is `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`.  

:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
Which of these is not divisible by `9`?  

* [ ] `12 × 36`
* [ ] `18 × 24`
* [x] `33 × 35`
* [ ] `54 × 21`
* [ ] `15 × 39`
{.col-5}

---

For `12 × 36`, `18 × 24`, `54 × 21` and `15 × 39`, each term of the product has a factor of `3`, so the product is divisible by `9`.  

`33 × 35` only has one factor of `3`, and is not divisible by `9`.  

:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
How many ways are there to arrange the four integers `1, 2, 3` and `4` so that no two adjacent numbers have the same parity?  

(Two number have the same parity if they are both odd or both even.)  

<input solution="8"/>  

---

We have four choices for the first number.  

Once that is chosen, then whichever number shares its parity must go into the third position.  

To see this, first note that it can’t go into the second position because adjacent numbers must have a different parity.  

It also can’t go in the fourth position because that would leave the remaining two numbers next to each other and they have the same parity.  

So the only remaining choice is which way around to put those remaining two numbers in the second and fourth place. There are two such ways.  

To recap, we have two choices:  

* Which number to place in the first position (__four ways__)  
* Which way around to place the two numbers that do not share the first number’s parity in the second and fourth position (__two ways__)  

This leaves a total of `4 × 2 = 8` possible combinations.

The radius of the grey circle is 1. What is the radius of the quarter-circle?  

* [ ] `2`
* [ ] `2 + sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `2sqrt(2)+1`
* [x] `1 + sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `sqrt(2)`

---

![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/11-quarter-circle-solution.png){image align="right"}
The red line is the radius of the quarter circle.  

It can be split into two parts: the radius of the grey circle, which is `1`, and a slightly longer segment.  

The slightly longer segment is the diagonal of a square whose side length equals the radius of the grey circle.  

By Pythagoras the longer segment has length `sqrt(2)`.  

So the total length of the red line is `1 + sqrt(2)`.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
In this question, `a` and `b` are non-zero single digits.  

The sum of the digits of the nine-digit number '`aaaabbbbb`' is equal to the two-digit number '`ab`'.  

What is the ratio of `a` to `b`?

* [ ] `1:1`
* [ ] `1:2`
* [x] `2:3`
* [ ] `3:4`
* [ ] `4:5`
{.col-5}

---

The number '`ab`' can be written as `10a + b`, giving the equation `4a + 5b = 10a + b`.  

This can be simplified to `4b = 6a`.  

Thus `a/b = 4/6 = 2/3`, so `a:b = 2:3`.   
:::


## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
Peter drives from A to B at an average speed of `20` mph.  

His drive back from B to A is at an average speed of `25` mph and takes `6` minutes less.  

How far in miles, is it from A to B?  

* [ ] `6`
* [ ] `8`
* [x] `10`
* [ ] `12`
* [ ] `15`
{.col-5}

---


Let `x` be the number of miles from A to B.  

It takes Peter `x/20` hours to drive from A to B at `20` mph and `x/25` hours to drive from B to A at `25` mph.  

The difference in the time taken for these two legs of the journey is `6` minutes, or `1/10` hours.

This means that `1/10 = x/20  -  x/25 = x/100`.

Solving this equation gives `x = 100/10 = 10` miles.

## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
In the diagram below, `ABCD` is a square and the point `E` is outside the square so that `CDE` is an equilateral triangle.  

The line `EB` crosses `CD` at the point `F`.  

Find Angle `DFE` (give your answer as a whole number).  

![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/14-trianglesquare.png){image align="center"}

<input solution="75"/>  

---

Since `ABCD` is a square, `∠BCD = 90°`, and since `CDE` is an equilateral triangle, `∠DCE = 60°`.  

Thus `∠BCE = ∠BCD + ∠DCE = 90°  + 60°  = 150°`.  

As `CDE` is an equilateral triangle, `EC = DC` and also, because `ABCD` is a square, `DC = CB`.  

Hence `EC = CB` and `ECB` is an isosceles triangle.  

So `∠CEB = ∠CBE = 1/2(180  -  150)°  = 15°`.

Hence `∠EFC = 180°  -  60°  -  15°  = 105°`.  

Finally, `∠DFE = 180°  -  105°  = 75°` as angles on a straight line sum to `180°`.

## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
Kanga wants to multiply three different numbers from the following list: `-5, -3, -1, 2, 4, 6`.  

What is the smallest result she could obtain?  

* [ ] `-200`
* [x] `-120`
* [ ] `-90`
* [ ] `-48`
* [ ] `-15`

---

The result furthest from zero is obtained by multiplying the three numbers furthest from zero, namely `-5, 4` and `6`.  

This gives `-120`, which is negative and hence is the smallest possible result.

## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/16-town-signs.jpg){image align="right"}
The shortest path from Atown to Cetown runs through Betown.  

The two signposts shown are set up at different places along this path.  

What distance is written on the broken sign?  

* [x] `1` km
* [ ] `3` km
* [ ] `4` km
* [ ] `5` km
* [ ] `9` km
{.col-5}

---

The information on the signs pointing to Atown and the signs pointing to Cetown both tell us that the distance between signs is:  

`(7 - 2)` km `= (9 - 4)` km `= 5` km.  

Therefore the distance which is written on the broken sign is `(5 - 4)` km = `1` km.

## 17.
::: problem id=17_1 marks=1
Anna wants to walk `5` km on average each day in March.  

At bedtime on `16`th March, she realises that she has walked `95` km so far.  

What distance does she need to walk on average for the remaining days of the month to achieve her target?  

* [ ] `5.4` km
* [ ] `5` km
* [x] `4` km
* [ ] `3.6` km
* [ ] `3.1` km
{.col-5}

---

The total distance Anna wants to walk is `(31 × 5)` km `= 155` km.  

Since she has walked `95` km up to the `16`th March, she has `(155  -  95)` km `= 60` km to walk in `(31  -  16)` days `= 15` days.  

Therefore the distance, in km, that she needs to average per day is `60/15 = 4`.

## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
The mean score of the students who took a mathematics test was `6`.  

Exactly `60%` of the students passed the test.  

The mean score of the students who passed the test was `8`.  

What was the mean score of the students who failed the test?  

* [ ] `1`
* [ ] `2`
* [x] `3`
* [ ] `4`
* [ ] `5`
{.col-5}

---

Let the mean score of the `40%` of the students who failed the test be `x`.  

The information in the question tells us that `0.6 × 8 + 0.4 × x = 6`.  

Hence `0.4x = 1.2` and so `x = 3`.

## 19.
::: problem id=19_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/19-grid.jpg){image align="right"}
James wrote a different integer from `1` to `9` in each cell of a table.  

He then calculated the sum of the integers in each of the rows and in each of the columns of the table.  

Five of his answers were `12, 13, 15, 16` and `17`, in some order.  

What is his sixth answer?

* [x] `17`
* [ ] `16`
* [ ] `15`
* [ ] `14`
* [ ] `13`
{.col-5}

---

The total of the sums of the three rows of the table is equal to the sum of all the digits from `1` to `9`, which is `45`.  

Similarly, the total of the sums of the three columns of the table is also equal to `45`.  

Hence James' six answers add to `45 + 45 = 90`.  

The sum of the five answers given is `12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 73` and hence his sixth answer is `90  -  73 = 17`.  

_It is left as an exercise to find a possible arrangement of the digits `1` to `9` that actually gives these six sums._

The cube shown is divided into `64` small cubes.  

Exactly one of the cubes is grey, as shown in the diagram.  

Two cubes are said to be 'neighbours' if they have a common face.  

On the first day, the white neighbours of the grey cube are changed to grey.  

On the second day, the white neighbours of all the grey cubes are changed to grey.  

How many grey cubes are there at the end of the second day?  

* [ ] `11`
* [ ] `13`
* [ ] `15`
* [ ] `16`
* [x] `17`
{.col-5}

The diagram below shows the day on which certain cubes turned grey. 

![](/resources/module-6-test-autumn/20-cube-solution.jpg){image align="center"}  

As can be seen, at the end of the second day there are `11 + 5 + 1 = 17` grey cubes.
