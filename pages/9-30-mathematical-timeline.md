__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. History of Mathematics

The terrific Mathigon website has loads of great material, including a timeline showing the great mathematicians of past centuries. Visit the [timeline](https://mathigon.org/timeline){target="_blank"} (click and it will open up in a new tab) and answer the three questions below. __Just enter the name given in the plum box__.

So, if the answer is John Napier, just enter __Napier__, because that is the name that appears in the plum-coloured box on the timeline:

__1.2__ Looking at mathematicians from 1700 to 1800, what is the surname of the mathematician who was from a family of mathematicians and scientists, which meant that he was banned from his father’s house for beating him at an award from the Paris Academy?

__1.3__ Looking at mathematicians from 1800 to 1900, what is the surname of the mathematician who proved that there are different sizes of infinity?  

(Clue – David Hilbert was so amazed by his work, that he said “No one shall expel us from the paradise that [HE] has created.”)

__2.1__ An equilateral triangle is placed inside a larger equilateral triangle so that the diagram has three lines of symmetry.  

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 100
* [ ] 110
* [ ] 120
* [ ] 130
* [x] 150

We label the vertices in the diagram as shown.  

Because the figure is symmetrical about the line `PS`, `∠PSU = ∠PST`.  

Since the triangle `STU` is equilateral, `∠TSU = 60°`.

The angles at a point have sum 360°. Therefore:  

`∠PSU + ∠PST + ∠TSU = 360°`  

and so  

`∠PSU + ∠PSU + 60° = 360°`.  

It follows that  

`∠PSU = 1/2 (360° - 60°) = 1/2 (300°) = 150°`.  

Therefore `x = 150`.

## 3. Cannonball Numbers

Last week, you watched a video about the mathematical problem of sphere packing.  

This week, Matt Parker looks a problem all about stacking spheres. Take a look at the question below.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__  If you stack 90,525,801,730 cannonballs in a pyramid, with a base shaped as a 31,265-agon, then how many layers of cannonballs will be in the pyramid?

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ How many weeks are there in `8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1` minutes?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

There are `60 = 6 × 5 × 2` minutes in an hour, `24 = 8 × 3` hours in a day and 7 days in a week. It follows that the number of weeks in `8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1` minutes is:


`(8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/((6 × 5 × 2) × (8 × 3) × 7) = 4 × 1 = 4`, after cancelling.

## 5. The world’s best chalk

I spotted this terrific video on the Great Big Story channel: “Once upon a time, not long ago, the math world fell in love ... with a chalk. But not just any chalk! This was Hagoromo: a Japanese brand so smooth, so perfect that some wondered if it was made from the tears of angels.”  

Take a look and answer this question.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
