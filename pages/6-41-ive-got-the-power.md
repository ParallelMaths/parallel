*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Power shortcuts

Much of good maths actually avoids carrying out calculations.  

Squaring numbers (also known as the power of 2) isn’t too bad, multiply it by itself:  

`4^2 = 4 × 4 = 16`  

But when the power gets bigger the problem becomes exponentially more difficult.  

`4^854` is 515 digits long, we couldn’t possibly fit it in a standard size calculator!  

However, by applying some clever maths we can still figure out some useful information about this number.

::: problem id=1_5 marks=3
__1.5__ Other numbers create last digit patterns when we raise them to different powers.  

Using a calculator write down this first ten powers of 3:  

* `3^1` = ?  
* `3^2` = ?  
* `3^3` = ?  
...
* `3^10` = ?  

What is the cycle created by the units digits?  

* [ ] 3, 9, 3, 9 
* [x] 3, 9, 7, 1
* [ ] 1, 2, 3, 4
* [ ] 3, 6, 9, 0
{.col-4}

^^^ hint id=1_5_1 marks=1
Here are the first ten powers of three:

* `3^1 = 3`
* `3^2 = 9`
* `3^3 = 27`
* `3^4 = 81`
* `3^5 = 243`
* `3^6 = 729`
* `3^7 = 2,187`
* `3^8 = 6,561`
* `3^9 = 19,683`
* `3^10 = 59,049`

Look at the last digits, what is the repeating pattern?

## 2. Some more puzzles where you can use clever thinking to avoid doing any long calculations

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
![](/resources/6-41-ive-got-the-power/2-1-calendar.jpg){image align="right"}
__2.1__ If today is Monday, what day of the week will it be in 698 days time? 

* [ ] Monday
* [ ] Tuesday
* [ ] Wednesday
* [x] Saturday
* [ ] Sunday

---

698 is only 2 less than 700, which is a multiple of 7.  

Every multiple of 7 brings you back to the same day of the week!  

So the 700th day will be a Monday again, counting back two the 698th day is a Saturday.

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
![](/resources/6-41-ive-got-the-power/2-2-zigzag.jpg){image align="right"}
__2.2__ In this figure, the triangles are all equilateral.  

The dotted line is 12 cm long.  

How long in total is the zigzag line?

* [ ] 12 cm
* [ ] 16 cm
* [ ] 18 cm
* [x] 24 cm
* [ ] 28 cm
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
The combined length of two bits of the zigzag line that make up the first triangle are double the length of the dotted base, because it is an equilateral triangle... and this will be true for every zigzag triangle.  
^^^

---

The combined length of two bits of the zigzag line that make up the first triangle are double the length of the dotted base, because it is an equilateral triangle... and this will be true for every zigzag triangle.  

So, the combined length of all the zigzag bits will be double the length of all the dotted base, i.e., 2 × 12 cm = 24 cm.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
