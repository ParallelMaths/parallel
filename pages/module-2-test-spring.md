<input type="number" solution="100"/> 

---

Angles in a quadrilateral sum to 360°, so the missing angle, in degrees, is 360 - (155 + 55 + 50) = 100
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If there are twice as many girls as there are boys in a class, what is the ratio of boys to girls? 

* [ ] 1:1
* [x] 1:2
* [ ] 1:3
* [ ] 2:1
* [ ] 3:1
{.col-5}

---

For every boy there are two girls, so the ratio of boys to girls is 1:2.
:::


## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is divisible by 2, 3 and 4? 

* [ ] 238
* [ ] 239
* [x] 240
* [ ] 241
* [ ] 242
{.col-5}

---

* 239 and 241 are odd and are therefore not divisible by 2   
* 238 and 242 are not divisible by 3 or 4 (use either divisibility check) 
* 240 is 24 × 10 and 24 = 2 × 3 × 4, so we can see that 240 contains these three factors 
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
Which of these is a regular quadrilateral? 

* [ ] Parallelogram
* [ ] Kite
* [ ] Rectangle
* [ ] Rhombus
* [x] Square

---

Regular means that all the sides have the same length and all the interior angles are equal (90° in the case of a quadrilateral).  

Only a square fits this description.  
:::


## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is smallest? 

* [x] `2^5`
* [ ] `4^3`
* [ ] `6^2`
* [ ] `2^6`
* [ ] `8^2`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are: 

* `2^5 = 32`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `6^2 = 36`
* `2^6 = 64`
* `8^2 = 64`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What is the mean of the numbers 6, 6, 8, 10, 15? 

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

---

There are five numbers in the list so the mean is given by: 

`(6 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 15)/5 = 9`
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what is the probability that you get two sixes?

* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `1/36`
* [ ] `1/18`
{.col-5}

---

The probability is given by:  

`1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36`
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
Which of the following numbers is divisible by 4?

* [ ] 1234
* [ ] 2314
* [x] 4312
* [ ] 3142
* [ ] None of these
{.col-5}

---

The divisibility check for 4 requires that we only consider the two-digit number formed by the final two digits.  

Since 12 is divisible by 4 then, using that check, we deduce that 4312 is also divisible by 4.  

We can dismiss the other cases as 34, 14 and 42 are not divisible by 4.
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
In the six-digit number `n5n2n3` the first, third and fifth digits are the same.  

For which value of `n` is this number divisible by 3?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [x] There is no such value of `n`
{.col-5}

---

By the divisibility check for 3, the number is divisible by 3 precisely when the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  

The sum of the digits is `n + 5 + n + 2 + n + 3 = 3n + 10`.  

This is never divisible by 3 because `(3n + 10)/3 = n + 10/3` (so there is always a remainder of 1).  

So no value of `n` will work (this method is quicker than checking all the options in turn!) 
:::


## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
What is the sum of all the positive integers between 1 and 200 inclusive (ie 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 198 + 199 + 200)?

* [ ] 5,050
* [ ] 10,100
* [ ] 200,000
* [x] 20,100
* [ ] 8,080
{.col-5}

---

Using Gauss’s shortcut, we can rewrite the sum as 100 pairs of 201:  

* 1 + 200 = 201
* 2 + 199 = 201
* 3 + 198 = 201

and so on.  

Therefore the total sum is 201 × 100 = 20,100.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-2-test-spring/12-triangle.png){image align="right"}
In the diagram, AB = AC and BD = BC.  

Angle BAC is 40°. What is angle BDC?  

* [ ] 40°
* [ ] 80°
* [ ] 110°
* [ ] 140°
* [x] 70°

---

Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles and angle ACB = angle CBA.  

Since these two angles combine with the 40° to make 180° (angles in a triangle), they are each 70°.  

Since BD = BC, triangle BDC is isosceles and angle BDC = angle DCB.  

But angle DCB is angle ACB, which we have shown is 70°.  

Therefore angle BDC is also 70°.

## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
If `2(x + 4) – 4 = 3x – 9`, what is `x`?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 9
* [x] 13
* [ ] -5
* [ ] -7
{.col-5}

---

* Expand the brackets:  `2x + 8 – 4 = 3x – 9` 
* Subtract `2x` from both sides:  `8 – 4 = x – 9` 
* Add 9 to both sides:  `8 – 4 + 9 = x` 
* Simplify the left-hand side:  `13 = x` 
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
I think of a number, double it, subtract 15, add my original number and end up with half the original number.  

What number did I think of?

* [ ] -2
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 4
* [x] 6
* [ ] 10
{.col-5}

---

Model the problem as an equation. The unknown, `x`, is the original number. Follow the steps:  

* Double:  `2x` 
* Subtract 15:  `2x - 15` 
* Add the original number:  `2x - 15 + x` 
* End up with half the original number:  `2x - 15 + x = 1/2 x` 

Now solve this equation:  

* Collect like terms:  `3x - 15 = 1/2 x` 
* Multiple both sides by 2:  `6x - 30 = x` 
* Add 30 to both sides:  `6x = x + 30` 
* Subtract `x` from both sides:  `5x = 30` 
* Divide both sides by 5:  `x = 6`

The diagram shows a large square which has been divided into four smaller squares.  

It also shows both diagonals of the large square and two diagonals of the smaller squares.  

What fraction of the area of the large square has been shaded? 

* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [ ] `5/8`
* [x] `9/16`
* [ ] `11/16`

---

* Starting on the top left square and going clockwise, the shaded parts make up `1/2`,`1/2`,`3/4` and `1/2` of their respective squares.   
* Each of the four squares is `1/4` of the whole square, so, as a fraction of the whole square, the shaded parts are `1/8`, `1/8`, `3/16` and `1/8`. 
* Sum these to get a total fraction of `9/16`.

## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
Abby has half as many apples as Mahika.  

Lily has twice as many apples as Abby.  

What fraction of all their apples does Lily have? 

* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `2/5`
* [ ] `3/5`
* [ ] `4/5`
* [ ] `1/10`
{.col-5}

---

* Let `x` be the number of apples that Abby has. 
* Then Mahika as `2x` apples and Lily has `2x` apples. 
* So Lily has `2x` apples out of a total of `5x` apples, i.e. she has `2/5` of the apples.

A hexagon is formed by arranging three equilateral triangles, as shown in the diagram.  

The side-length of the largest equilateral triangle is 15cm.  

What is the perimeter, in cm, of the hexagon?

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 45
* [x] 60
* [ ] 75
* [ ] more information needed

---

Let the side-lengths, in cm, of the two smaller triangles be `x` and `y`, as shown.  

Then from the dotted line we can see that `x + y = 15`.  

The perimeter of the hexagon, in cm, is therefore:  

`15 + 15 + 2x + 2y = 30 + 2(x + y) = 30 + 30 = 60`

The digits 1, 3, 6, 5 and 7 are to be placed in the grid, one to a cell, to make a correct mathematical statement.  

What number should come immediately after the division sign?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3

The only correct statement that uses these digits is `35 ÷ 7 + 1 = 6`.

PWRS is a square with area 64 cm<sup>2</sup>`.  

The point T is inside the square.  

PTS is a triangle with area 17 cm<sup>2</sup>.

Denote the perpendicular heights of PTS and QRT h₁, h₂, respectively.  

The base of both triangles is the side length of the square, which is 8cm.   

So the areas of QRT and PTS are (in cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively, `1/2` × 8 × h₁ and `1/2` × 8 × h₂.  

The sum of these two areas is `1/2` × 8 × (h₁ + h₂).  

Now, h₁ + h₂  is the height of the square, so this simplifies to `1/2 × 8 × 8 = 32`.  

So the two triangles have a combined area, in cm<sup>2</sup>, of 32 and since we are told that PTS has an area of 17 cm<sup>2</sup>, triangle QRT must make up the remaining 15 cm<sup>2</sup>.

Simon eats three equal-sized bowls of porridge, one after the other.  

When he has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, what fraction of the porridge in the second bowl has he eaten?  

* [x] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/9`
* [ ] `1/12`
* [ ] `2/15`
{.col-5}

---

Let the amount of porridge in each bowl be _p_.  

Then, when Simon has eaten `4/9` of the total amount of porridge, he has eaten
`4/9 × 3p = 4p/3 = p + p/3`, so he has eaten `1/3` of the second bowl.
