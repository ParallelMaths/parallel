# Year 8: Summer Problems #4

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

This is the fourth of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. 


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is 2010 + (+2010) + (-2010) - (+2010) - (-2010)?

* [ ] 0
* [X] 2010
* [ ] 4020
* [ ] 6030
* [ ] 8040
{.col-5}

---

The expression = 2010 + 2010 - 2010 - 2010 + 2010 = (2010 - 2010) + (2010 - 2010) + 2010 = 2010.

If the net shown is folded to make a cube, which letter is opposite X?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [x] D
* [ ] E

---

Let X be on the top face of the cube. If the base is placed on a horizontal surface, then A, B, C, E will all be on vertical faces of the cube and D will be on the base, opposite X.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
Mr Owens wants to keep the students quiet during a Mathematics lesson. He asks them to multiply all the numbers from 1 to 99 together and then tell him the last-but-one digit of the result.

What is the correct answer?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

---

As 2, 5 and 10 are all factors of the correct product, this product is a multiple of 100. So the last digit and the last-but-one digit are both zero.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
At the Marldon Apple-Pie-Fayre bake-off, prize money is awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd
places in the ratio 3 : 2 : 1.

Last year Mrs Keat and Mr Jewell shared third prize equally.

What fraction of the total prize money did Mrs Keat receive?

* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/10`
* [x] `1/12`
{.col-5}

---

Third prize is worth one-sixth of the total prize money, so Mrs Keat received half of that amount, that is one-twelfth of the total.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-4/5-lusona-question.gif){image align="right"}
The diagram shows a Lusona, a sand picture of the Tshokwe people from the West Central Bantu area of Africa.

To draw a Lusona the artist uses a stick to draw a single line in the sand, starting and ending in the same place without lifting the stick in between.

At which point could this Lusona have started?

* [ ] A
* [x] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

It is necessary to find a route for which the line is broken the first time it passes through any intersection and solid when it passes through that intersection for the second time.

Only the route which starts at B and heads away from D satisfies this condition.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
One of the examination papers for Amy’s Advanced Arithmetic Award was worth 18% of the final total. The maximum possible mark on this paper was 108 marks.

How many marks were available overall?

* [ ] 420
* [ ] 480
* [ ] 540
* [ ] 560
* [x] 600
{.col-5}

---

As 108 marks represented 18% of the final total, 6 marks represented 1% of the final total. So this total was 600.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=2
![](/resources/2018summer-8-4/7-pat-question.gif){image align="right"}
Pat needs to travel down every one of the roads shown at least once, starting and finishing at home.

What is the smallest number of the five villages that Pat will have to visit more than once?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5

---

Villages which have more than two roads leading to them (or from them) must all be visited more than once as a single visit will involve at most two roads. So Bentonville, Pencaster and Wytham must all be visited more than once.

The route Home, Bentonville, Greendale, Wytham, Bentonville, Pencaster, Home, Wytham, Horndale, Pencaster, Home starts and finishes at Home and visits both Greendale and Horndale exactly once so the minimum number of villages is three.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
Kiran writes down six different prime numbers, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, all less than 20, such that `p + q = r + s = t + u`. What is the value of `p + q`?

* [ ] 16
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 22
* [x] 24
{.col-5}

---

The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. It is not possible for 2 to be one of the six numbers Kiran wrote down, since that would give one of the pairs an odd sum, whereas both of the other pairs would add up to an even number.

The sum of the remaining 7 primes is 75 which is a multiple of 3. The sum of the six primes making up the three pairs must also be a multiple of 3 since each pair has the same total.

So the odd prime not used in the six pairs must be a multiple of 3 too. Therefore 3 is the
odd prime not used. So each pair totals 72 ÷ 3, that is 24, and the pairs are 5 + 19 7 + 17 11 + 13.

## 9.

::: problem id=9_1 marks=3
![](/resources/2018summer-8-4/9-multiplication-queston.gif){image align="right"}
What is the value of `P + Q + R` in the multiplication on the right?

* [x] 13
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 9

---

The three-digit number `RRR` is equal to 111 multiplied by the single digit `R`.

So `PQPQ × R = 639027 ÷ 111 = 5757`. Now `PQPQ` equals the two-digit number `PQ` multiplied by 101.

So `PQ × R = 5757 ÷ 101 = 57`. The only ways in which 57 may be expressed as the product of a two-digit number and a single digit are 57 × 1 and 19 × 3.

So `P = 5`, `Q = 7`, `R = 1` or  `P = 1`, `Q = 9`, `R = 3`. In both cases, `P + Q + R = 13`.

And that’s the end of the fourth Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
