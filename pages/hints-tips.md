### Can I use Parallel in maths clubs or in lessons?  

You’re welcome to use Parallel in any way that you find useful, BUT it is designed so that students can work independently at home, so it seems a shame to use valuable classroom time for an activity that can be completed in the student’s own time.  

By all means, share particularly interesting elements of Parallel with a whole class, or occasionally go through a particular question, but the routine of completing Parallel is best done at home.

### Which students are best suited for Parallel?  

Parallel is difficult and covers unfamiliar topics, so it is aimed at ambitious students who are quite strong, and who would benefit from being stretched further. It is far better to have a small group of students who complete Parallel every week. It could be seen as part of their regular homework, but I hope that students would seeing as something more exciting.   

It is far better to have a small group of students who complete the whole year of Parallelograms, rather than a whole class that starts reluctantly in September and fizzles out in October.  

Of course, nobody is excluded from doing Parallel. If any student volunteers to complete the Parallelograms, then that is a good indication that they are the right person for Parallel. Attitude is just as important as aptitude.

### Do the students have to stick to the weekly schedule of Parallel?  

If students are going to progress from being good mathematicians to being great mathematicians, then need to become comfortable with new and challenging ideas, and they need simply need maths beyond the GCSE syllabus and lots of it. If students are happy to with a grade 9 at GCSE, then they do not need to bother with Parallel. However, if they are serious about doing Further Maths and studying at maths-based degree at university, then completing Parallelograms EVERY week will help them work their way towards enjoying difficult mathematical ideas.  

If a student is late one week or misses a Parallelogram, they are always available to be completed, preferably sooner rather than later.   

If a student starts mid-year, then they could start back at Week 1 and try to catch up, or they could use the holidays as an opportunity to catch up.

### Do I need to go through the solutions?  

After hitting the submit button, students can immediately access the answers and explanations. Students are strongly encouraged to go through the solutions for those questions they got wrong. This is probably the biggest opportunity for learning.

### My students complain that Parallelograms (a) take up too much of their spare time, (b) are too difficult and (c) cover topics beyond the classroom?  

Too a large extent, students just need some time to get used to the idea that they can spend extra time working on subjects they are already good at, that doing difficult questions is good for their brain and that learning ideas not in the end of year exam is cool.  

The biggest concern that students seem to have is that they sometimes score less than 50%, and they deem this as a failure. It might help to remind them that none of these scores matter, none of them go on their school record, the Parallelograms are meant to be difficult and getting things wrong is an opportunity for learning. If lots of students were getting 100% every week, then that would mean I was not doing my job properly.

### How do students receive awards for taking part in Parallel every week?  

Students can earn certificates each year for completing Parallelograms and attending maths circles, and when they leave at age 16 they will receive their graduation diploma, which will document everything they have achieved in the Parallel Universe.
