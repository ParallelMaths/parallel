# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 10_ Witchsticks

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain.  

*	Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
*	But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	Musical Challenge

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ This clip is from University Challenge on BBC2 – listen carefully and add up all the numbers in the song.

<input solution="176"/>

M62 + 39 miles + 45 minutes + 30 miles = 176

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge (2012 extension)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
__2.1__ A pattern that repeats every six symbols starts as shown below:

♥ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♥ ♠ ♥ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♥ ♠ ...
{.text-center}

Which is the 1001<sup>st</sup> symbol?


* [x] ♥
* [ ] ♠
* [ ] ♦
* [ ] ♣
{.col-4}

---

Our pattern repeats after six symbols, so to find the 1,001<sup>st</sup> symbol we need to work out:
1,001 ÷ 6 = 166 remainder 5.

So, the 6-symbol pattern repeats itself 166 times, and the 5 symbol will sit in the 1,001<sup>st</sup> position. So the answer is the heart symbol, ♥.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge (2012 extension)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1.__ One day Beth, Carolyn and George read a book of 240 pages. They take it in turns to read a page, always in the order Beth, Carolyn and George.

The next day their cousin Sam comes to stay and they read the book again, taking it turns to read a page, always in the order Sam, George, Carolyn and Beth.

How many pages are read by the same person on the two days?

<input solution="60"/>  

---

Beth used to read every 3<sup>rd</sup> page `(3n + 1)`, ie 1, __4__, 7, 10, 13, __16__, 19, 22, 25, __28__,...

Now Beth reads every 4<sup>th</sup> page, ie __4__, 8, 12, __16__, 20, 24, __28__,...

Beth read 1 in 3 of the original pages, and then Beth reads 1 in 4 of them again.

So, if she read 80 pages originally, she now reads 20 of those same pages again.

The same will be true for Carolyn and George, so 3 × 20 pages = 60 pages will be read by the same person when the book is re-read with the help of Sam.

## 4. How does the sun shine?

Derek Muller from YouTube’s Veritasium channel asks people to explain the mechanism that is responsible for the sun shining. Have a think yourself before you watch Derek explain the physics behind sunshine.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge bonus (2012 extension)

As the Junior Maths Challenge is only a few days away, here is a bonus (and particularly tough) JMC question to stretch your brain.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=3
__5.1.__ After playing 500 games, my success rate at Spider Solitaire is 49%. Assume that I now lose every third game, so that after 500 games my results are Win, Win, Loss, Win, Win, Loss, … .

What is the least number of extra games I need to play in order that my success rate becomes at least 50%?

<input solution="28"/>  

---

Since I have won 49% of my first 500 games, so far I have won:

`(49/100) × 500 = 49 × 5 = 245` games.

So I have lost `500 – 245 = 255` games. I need now to win enough games so that I have won as many as I have lost.

So, assuming I win 2 out of 3 games from now on, I get the following pattern:

| # games | Wins | Losses |
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 500 | 245 | 255 |
| 503 | 247 | 256 |
| 506 | 249 | 257 |
| 509 | 251 | 258 |
| 512 | 253 | 259 |
| 515 | 255 | 260 |
| 518 | 257 | 261 |
| 521 | 259 | 262 |
| 524 | 261 | 263 |
| 527 | 263 | 264 |
| 530 | 265 | 265 |
{.grid}

So, it would be easy to assume that I need to play 30 more games, so that the number of wins equals the number of losses. However, let’s take a closer look at what happens towards the end, bearing in mind the win-win-loss pattern.

| # games | Wins | Losses |
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 527 | 263 | 264 |
| 528 | 264 | 264 |
| 529 | 265 | 264 |
| 530 | 265 | 265 |
{.grid}

So, earliest that the number of wins equals the number of loses is after 528 games, or after 28 more games.

## 6. Rattleback

Watch this video of one of the most mysterious objects in the universe. It’s called a rattleback, and you can win one if you succeed at the challenge in the _Further Stuff_ section below.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,

## Additional Stuff

__VAX! – a game about epidemic prevention.__

Take a look at the game at the [__VAX!__ website](http://vax.herokuapp.com/){target="_blank"}, which is all about showing how maths can help reduce the spread of disease. We are all connected to each other and it is through these connections that diseases spread. You can reduce the spread of disease by breaking these connections, either by vaccinating people or putting them in quarantine.

It is definitely worth looking at the whole site and learning about the maths, disease and networks of connections, but if you want to jump straight in to the game then this is how to find it and how to win a rattleback.

*	Go to [http://vax.herokuapp.com/game](http://vax.herokuapp.com/game){target="_blank"}
*	Clink on EASY (try MEDIUM & HARD later)
*	Start vaccinating those dots that are most likely to spread disease.
*	When the disease starts, begin quarantining dots.
*	If you want to try again, hit RETRY after you obtain your score.

Here is my best score and my current score.

![](/resources/8-10-witchsticks/additional-vax.png){image align="center"}

If you can beat __94% (my current score)__ then you will go into the draw for winning a rattleback. If you can beat __96% (my best score)__, then you will definitely win a rattleback.

Just email me at [prizes@parallel.org.uk](mailto:prizes@parallel.org.uk) and include an image of your bar chart score. Good luck.
