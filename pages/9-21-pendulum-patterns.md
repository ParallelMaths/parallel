## 1. Harmonic Pendula

Take a look at this video of a collection of pendula (the plural of pendulum),
which behave in a beautiful and surprising way. It’s called a wave pendulum or
harmonic pendulum. It lasts three minutes, and it is worth watching right through
to the end to see the amazing effect.

Tom Rowett, who was in the video, has a huge and wonderful collection of odd objects,
and we will meet more of them in later Parallelograms. In this case, each pendulum
swings at a different rate, because it has a different length. In fact, there is
a formula that determines the relationship between the length of the pendulum and
the time it takes to swing from left to right and back to the left: `T = 2π √(L/g)`

where
* __T__ is the time of a complete swing in seconds.
* __π__ is 3.14... (Wow! Always nice to see π.)
* __L__ is the length of the pendulum in meters.
* __g__ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²). Don’t worry about this –
it is a bit of physics that describes how an object falls due to the Earth’s gravity.

If you had a pendulum that was as tall as a human, say 2 metres, how long would
it take to swing? If __L__ = 2 meters, then:

__T__ = `2 × 3.14 × sqrt(2/9.8) = 6.28 × sqrt(0.204) = 6.28 × 0.4518`

__T__ = `2.837` seconds.

So a 2 metre pendulum takes 2.837, or nearly 3 seconds, to swing back and forth.

__1.1__ If one of the pendula in the video is 0.15 meters long, how long is the
period of the swing?

* [ ] 0.10 seconds
* [ ] 0.15 seconds
* [ ] 0.39 seconds
* [x] 0.78 seconds
* [ ] 1.00 second

::: problem id=1_2 marks=3
__1.2__ If you wanted a pendulum to have a swing time of 1 second (__T__ = 1 second),
how long should the pendulum be? At the moment the equation gives you the time
(__T__) depending on the length (__L__), so it might be useful to rearrange the
equation so that you have the length depend on the time.

* [ ] 0.18 metres
* [x] 0.248 metres
* [ ] 0.99 metres
* [ ] 1.16 metres
* [ ] 1.8 metres

We want to know L for a T of 1 second, so:

`L = g(T ÷ (2π))^2`  

`L = 9.8 × (1 ÷ 6.28)^2`  

`L = 0.248` metres

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ The northern wheatear is a small bird weighing less than an ounce. Some northern wheatears migrate from sub-Saharan Africa to their Arctic breeding grounds, travelling almost 15 000 km. The journey takes just over 7 weeks. Roughly how far do they travel each day, on average?

* [ ] 1 km
* [ ] 9 km
* [ ] 30 km
* [ ] 90 km
* [x] 300 km
{.col-5}

---

There are `7 × 7 = 49` days in 7 weeks. So we will get a good estimate of the average distance travelled by a wheatear in 7 weeks by dividing the total distance travelled by 50.

Now `15000/50 = 1500/5 = 300`. So the average distance travelled is roughly 300 km.

## 3. Can you light a match with water?

This is a surprising video from Steve Mould, who shows that you can light a match using water, or at least the gaseous phase of water.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ Why is it possible to light a match with water?

* [x] Because the steam is super-heated.
* [ ] Because the steam is super-dry.
* [ ] Because the steam is super-fueled.
* [ ] Because the steam is super-oxygentated.
* [ ] Because the steam has super powers.

__4.1.__ The diagram shows four equal discs and a square. Each disc touches its two neighbouring discs. Each corner of the square is positioned at the centre of a disc. The side length of the square is `2/π`. What is the length of the perimeter of the figure?

* [ ] `3`
* [ ] `4`
* [ ] `3π/2`
* [x] `6`
* [ ] `2π`

^^^ hint id=2 marks=1
The radius of each circle is half the length of the square’s sides. If the square has sides of `2/π`, then the radius of each circle is `1/π`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3 marks=1
The perimeter of the shape is made up `4 × 3/4` circles. So the perimeter of the shape is `4 × 3/4 ×` the circumference of one full circle.
^^^

---

The radius of each disc is `1/π`, and hence its circumference is `2π × 1/π = 2`.  

The perimeter of the figure is made up of three-quarters of each of the four discs. Hence the length of the perimeter is `4 × (3/4 × 2) = 6`.

__5.1.__ What is the area of the figure in question 4.1?

The radius of each circle is half the length of the square’s sides. If the square has sides of `2/π`, then the radius of each circle is `1/π`.
^^^

---

The radius of each circle is half the length of the square’s sides. If the square has sides of `2/π`, then the radius of each circle is `1/π`.

The area of the shape is made up 4 x ¾ circles plus the area of the square. So the area of the shape is `(4 × 3/4 × π × (1/π)^2)` + `(2/π)^2` = `1.36`.
