# About

The Parallel Project aims to encourage young mathematicians to explore the world of mathematics by providing a weekly set of challenges that are designed to stretch brains and broaden horizons. The goal is to help good mathematicians become strong, and to help strong mathematicians become brilliant.

This pilot version will run for only 4 weeks, but we hope to return in September with a continuous offering week after week designed for students in Y7 and Y8. In time, we hope to have materials that are accessible to all secondary students, right through to GCSE, and for children still in primary school.

Anyone can sign up, so please spread the work among your friends, family and classmates. However, the Parallel Project was originally devised as an add-on for students participating in the Top-Top Set Project. The Top-Top Sets have been established in for schools, so far, to help enthusiastic young mathematician to achieve their potential. You can find out more about Top-Top Sets [here](http://parallel.org.uk/tts).

Both the Top-Top Set Project and the Parallel Project are run by author Simon Singh and [Good Thinking](http://parallel.org.uk/good-thinking), a charity that promotes science and challenges pseudoscience.
