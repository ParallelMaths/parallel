__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. The Magic of 6,174

6,174 seems like an unassuming, random, 4 digit number - but it has an amazing property.  

Watch this video where University of Nottingham Professor Roger Bowley explains:

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ How would you describe the algorithm to arrive at 6,174?

* [x] Put the digits in order highest to lowest, reverse the order, and subtract
* [ ] Put the digits in order lowest to highest, reverse the order, and subtract
* [ ] Put the digits in order highest to lowest, reverse the order, and add

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ What happens if you start with the number 6,174?  

* [ ] The numbers will keep getting larger, heading to infinity
* [x] The numbers return to 6,174
* [ ] The numbers keep getting smaller, heading to negative infinity

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ I am about to start my day.  

In which order should I cary out the following instructions?  

- D = dry youself  
- G = get out of bed  
- P = put clothes on  
- T = take a shower  
- W = wake up  

* [ ] WDGPT
* [ ] PDTWG
* [ ] GDTPW
* [x] WGTDP
* [ ] PTDGW

## 2. A mysterious set of instructions

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ The “reverse and add” algorithm is famous for creating palindromic numbers (same forwards and backwards).  

The steps are:  

1. Reverse the digits  
2. Add  
3. Repeat until a palindrome is achieved  

How many times must you reverse and add before the number 86 becomes a palindrome?

<input type="number" solution="3"/>

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
Start with 86 + 68, is it a palindrome?  

If not, reverse the digits again and add.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
