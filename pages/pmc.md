# Parallel is offering 100 schools up to 50 free entries for this year’s Primary Maths Challenge

Our aim is to increase the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians, which is why we are offering selected schools funding to enter up to 50 students for this year’s Primary Maths Challenge, which takes place between November 7th and 18th.

The Primary Maths Challenge is aimed at students aged 8 to 11 years old, based anywhere in the world. Each year, the Primary Maths Challenge consists of 25 questions that will require students to use their __problem solving and reasoning skills__.

You can secure your free entry by [creating a teacher account on Parallel](/signup#teacher). It’s quick and free, and will give you access to other amazing opportunities throughout the year. You can find out more about [Parallel, our free maths circles and puzzle sheets, here](/?teachers).

Please note that places will be offered on a first come, first served basis. To be eligible, your school must not have participated in the Primary Maths Challenge in 2021.  

This is an excellent opportunity to push your keenest high-attaining maths students!
