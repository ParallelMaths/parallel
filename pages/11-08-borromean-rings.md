# Borromean rings

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

These challenges are a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics, most of which will be nothing to do with what you are doing at the moment in your classroom. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas, including a few questions that appear to have nothing to do with mathematics at all.

* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday 27 Oct if your whole class is doing parallelograms.  

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then examine the solution sheet to learn from your mistakes.  

As most of you will have a half-term coming up, this Parallelogram is longer than usual and has a couple of extra questions. And your next parallelogram will be in __two weeks time on 31st October__, and it will be appropriately terrifying.


## 1. Borromean rings

Borromean rings are a construction from Topology (a branch of mathematics concerned with deforming shapes, for example by stretching, twisting or crumpling).  

In a set of Borromean rings, if you remove any one of the rings, all of the others come apart.

Over a two-week period, the required number of visitors is 14 × 30,000 = 420,000. Hence the number required this week is 420,000 = 120,000 = 300,000.

Since `1/4 = 4/16` and `1/8 = 2/16`, the number midway between them is `3/16`.

## 3.	Impossible dart scores

This puzzle is all about the game of darts. If you’ve never played darts before, here are the rules:  

The board has 20 sectors numbered 1-20. Within each sector, there are smaller sections which double or triple the value of that throw. For example, throwing a dart in the double section of the sector labelled 3 gives you 6 points. In addition, there is the bullseye in the middle worth 50 points, and a section outside the bullseye worth 25 points.  

On each turn, a player throws 3 darts, and their score is the sum of the scores for each throw.  

180 is the largest possible score, obtained by throwing three triple 20s.  
179 is an impossible score.  

There are eight other impossible scores.  

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ Which of these is an impossible score?

* [ ] 158
* [ ] 168
* [x] 178
{.col-3}

^^^ hint id=3_1 marks=1
158 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 16, so a triple 20, followed by a bullseye, followed by triple 16 gets you 158. Can you improve this score by 10 or 20?
^^^

---

158 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 16. So, a triple 20, followed by a bullseye, followed by triple 16 gets you 158.  

Swapping the bullseye for another triple 20 give you 168.  

168 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 16.  

Given that the question implies that one of them is impossible, we can assume that 178 is impossible.

^^^ hint id=3_2 marks=1
165 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 15. So, two triple 20s followed by a triple 15 gets you 165.  

Can you reduce this score by 1 or 2?
^^^

---

164 =  3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 18.  

165 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 15.  

Given that the question implies that one of them is impossible, we can assume that 163 is impossible.

::: problem id=3_3 marks=5
__3.3__	Of the 9 impossible scores, which one is smallest?

<input solution="163"/>

^^^ hint id=3_3_1 marks=1
It’s best to start by considering the largest score, 180 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 20. We can’t reduce this by 1 or 2, but we can reduce it by 3 by changing any of the 20s to 19s.  

180 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 20.  
179 impossible  
178 impossible  
177 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 19.

Continuing in this way will give us ‘gaps’ of two. When will we be able to ‘fill’ these gaps, reducing by 1 or 2?
^^^

^^^ hint id=3_3_2 marks=1
171 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 17. The last throw, 3 × 17, is equal to 51. You can reduce this by 1 by replacing this with a bull’s eye.  
168 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 16. You can reduce this by 1 by reducing the second throw by 10 using the bull’s eye, and increasing the third throw by 9.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3_3 marks=1
167 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 19.  
You can’t use the same trick to reduce this by 1, as you can’t have 3 × 22, so 166 is impossible.  
You can use the same trick to reduce 165 by 1.  
165 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 15, and  
164 = 3 × 20 + 50+ 3 × 18.  

Again, you can’t increase the last throw by 9, as you can’t have 3 × 21.
^^^

^^^ hint id=3_4 marks=1
163 is impossible.  
162 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 14.  
161 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 17.  

Can you reduce this by 1, starting by replacing the first throw with a bull’s eye?
^^^

It's all about the spacing between triples. There's always a gap of two. But the bullseye becomes useful at 170 so that one of the gaps between triples disappears. Then another bull comes into play at 160 so that below 160 there is always a combination of triple 20s and 50 that fills in the space between adjacent triples.  

180 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 20  
179 impossible  
178 impossible  
177 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 19  
176 impossible  
175 impossible  
174 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 18  
173 impossible  
172 impossible  
171 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 17  
170 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 50 in creeps the bull  
169 impossible  
168 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 16  
167 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 19  
166 impossible  
165 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 15  
164 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 18  
163 impossible  
162 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 14  
161 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 17  
160 = 50 + 50 + 3 × 20 another bull can be used  
159 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 13  
158 = 3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 16  
157 = 50 + 50 + 3 × 19  
There are 9 impossible scores:  
163 166 169 172 173 175 176 178 179

Some scores can be obtained in more than one way.  

For example, 100 = 3 × 20 + 20 + 20, and 100 = 2 × 20 + 2 × 20 + 20.

::: problem id=3_4 marks=3
__3.4__ Which is the largest score which can be obtained in two different ways?

<input solution="174"/>

---

164 =  3 × 20 + 50 + 3 × 18.  

165 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 15.  

Start by considering the largest score, 180 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 20. We can reduce it by 3 by changing any of the 20s to 19s. This gives us only one way to score 177.  

Now we have 177 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 19, which we can reduce by 3 in two different ways, by changing a 20 to 19, or a 19 to 18. This gives us two ways to score 174.  

174 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 20 + 3 × 18 = 3 × 20 + 3 × 19 + 3 × 19.

__4.1__ Equal regular pentagons are placed together to form a ring in the manner shown. The diagram shows the first three pentagons. How many _more_ are needed to complete the ring?

* [ ] 6

* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=1
The angle sum of a pentagon is 540°.
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_2 marks=1
This means the interior angle of a regular pentagon is 540 ÷ 5 = 108°. Therefore, each interior angle of the regular polygon formed by the inner sides of the pentagon is 360 – 2 × 108 = 144°.
![](/resources/11-08-borromean-rings/4-pentagon-answer.jpg){image align="center"}

^^^ hint id=4_3 marks=1
The exterior angle of the polygon is 180° - 144° = 36°, and the sum of exterior angles in any polygon is 360°.

![](/resources/11-08-borromean-rings/4-pentagon-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
The interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108°.  

Therefore each interior angle of the regular polygon formed by the inner sides of the pentagons is (360 - 2 × 108)° = 144°.  

The exterior angle of this regular polygon 36° and hence it has 360 ÷ 36, ie 10 sides.  

Therefore 7 more pentagons are required.

These arcs meet on the circle, as shown.

Let `O` be the centre of the circle and let the points where the arcs meet be `C` and `D` respectively.  

`ABCD` is a square since its sides are all equal to the radius of the arc `CD` and `ACB = 90deg` (angle in a semicircle).  

In triangle `OCB`, `CB^2 = OC^2 + OB^2`, hence `CB = sqrt(2)` cm.

The area of the segment bounded by arc `CD` and diameter `CD` is equal to the area of sector `BCD` = the area of triangle `BCD`, ie:
