## 1. Radical mathematics

Khan Academy has created dozens of great online videos about mathematics, and hundreds more about a ton of other subjects, ranging from history to science. Take a look at this one, which is all about “Comparing irrational numbers with radicals”.

Did that make sense? If not, then re-watch the video before trying the questions below.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1.__ Which is bigger: `4 sqrt(2)` or `3sqrt(3)`?

* [x] `4 sqrt(2)` is bigger
* [ ] `3sqrt(3)` is bigger
* [ ] Neither, they are the same
{.col-3}

If we square both numbers `(4 sqrt(2))^2 = 16 × 2` and `(3sqrt(3))^2 = 9 × 3`, so the former is bigger.

__1.2.__ Which is bigger: `2sqrt(3)` or `sqrt(5)`?

* [x] `2sqrt(3)` is bigger
* [ ] `sqrt(5)` is bigger
* [ ] Neither, they are the same
{.col-3}

---

If we square both numbers `(2sqrt(3))^2 = 4 × 3` and `(sqrt(5))^2 = 5`, so the former is bigger.

__1.3.__ Which is bigger: `3 sqrt(4)` or `sqrt(36)`?

* [ ] `3 sqrt(4)` is bigger
* [ ] `sqrt(36)` is bigger
* [x] Neither, they are the same
{.col-3}

---

If we square both numbers `(3 sqrt(4))^2 = 9 × 4` and `sqrt(36)^2 = 36`, so they are the same.  

Alternatively, `3 sqrt(4) = 3 × 2 = 6`, while `sqrt(36) = 6`.

## 2. William Rowan Hamilton

The biggest theatre show in recent years to hit New York is a musical called “Hamilton”. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States of America, and the man responsible for setting up the American banking system. Many of the songs involve rap.  

It is incredible that someone (the brilliant Lin-Manuel Miranda) was able to create a hit show based on the life of a long-dead politician, whose life story was unknown to many Americans.  

Anyway, what has this got to do with maths? Tim Blais has a created a song and video based on the opening song from “Hamilton” – it is not about American politician Alexander Hamilton, but rather it is about the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. Watch the video and answer the three questions below.

In one of the diagrams, exactly one third of the circle is shaded. Which one?

The straight edges of the shaded sector which occupies one third of the area of the circle will make an angle equal to one third of a complete revolution, that is, an angle of `1/3 × 360° = 120°`.  

In diagram A the straight edges of the shaded sector make an angle of 90°. In diagram C these edges make an angle equal to 90° + 45° = 135°. The angles in diagrams D and E are even larger. So in none of these cases is exactly one third of the circle shaded.  

This leaves diagram B where the angle is between 90° and 135°. Therefore, this is the diagram where the angle is 120°. Hence it is the diagram where the shaded area occupies one third of the circle.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
__4.1__ A list of positive integers has a median of 8, a mode of 9 and a mean of 10.  

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the list?

* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=2
Because the list has a mode of 9, the integer 9 must occur at least twice in the list. Therefore, as the mean is 10, the list must include at least one integer which is greater than 10.  
^^^

---
Because the list has a mode of 9, the integer 9 must occur at least twice in the list. Therefore, as the mean is 10, the list must include at least one integer which is greater than 10.  

So the list includes at least three integers that are greater than 8. Because the median is 8, the list must also include at least three integers that are less than 8. It follows that there are at least six integers in the list.  

We now try and find a list of six integers with the required properties. We can suppose from what we already know that the list, in increasing order, is  

`p, q, r, 9, 9, u`  

where `r < 8` and `u > 10`.  

For this list to have median 8, we need to have `1/2 (r + 9) = 8`, and therefore `r = 7`. So the list, in increasing order is  

`p, q, 7, 9, 9, u`  

with `u > 10`.  

For this list to have mode 9, no other integer can occur more than once in the list. Therefore `p ≠ q` and `q ≠ 7`. So `p < q < 7`.  

For this list to have mean 10, we need to have `p + q + 7 + 9 + 9 + u = 6 × 10 = 60`, that is, `p + q + u + 25 = 60`.  

Therefore we require that `p + q + u = 35`, with `p < q < 7`, and `u > 10`.  

There is more than one way to choose `p`, `q` and `u` so as to meet these conditions. For example, the list  

5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 24  

has a median of 8, a mode of 9 and a mean of 10.  

We have found a list of 6 positive integers with the given properties. We have shown that no list of fewer than 6 positive integers has these properties. We conclude that the smallest possible number of integers in the list is 6.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Every day, Aimee goes up an escalator on her journey to work. If she stands still, it takes her 60 seconds to travel from the bottom to the top. One day the escalator was broken so she had to walk up it. This took her 90 seconds.  

How many seconds would it take her to travel up the escalator if she walked up at the same speed as before while it was working?

* [ ] 30
* [ ] 32
* [x] 36
* [ ] 45
* [ ] 75
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5_1 marks=2
We suppose that the distance from the bottom to the top of the escalator is `d` metres.  

Since it takes Aimee 60 seconds to travel this distance when she stands still, the escalator moves upwards at a speed of `d/60` metres per second.  

Since it takes Aimee 90 seconds to walk from the bottom to the top of the escalator when it is not moving, Aimee walks up the escalator at a speed of `d/90` metres per second.  
^^^

^^^ hint id=5_2 marks=1
It follows that when Aimee is walking at the same speed up the moving escalator she is moving at a speed of `(d/60 + d/90)` metres per second.
^^^

---

We suppose that the distance from the bottom to the top of the escalator is `d` metres.  

Since it takes Aimee 60 seconds to travel this distance when she stands still, the escalator moves upwards at a speed of `d/60` metres per second.  

Since it takes Aimee 90 seconds to walk from the bottom to the top of the escalator when it is not moving, Aimee walks up the escalator at a speed of `d/90` metres per second.  

It follows that when Aimee is walking at the same speed up the moving escalator she is moving at a speed of `(d/60 + d/90)` metres per second. Now  

(d/60 + d/90) = d(1/60 + 1/90) = d ((3 + 2)/180) = d (5/180) = d/36.  

So Aimee moves up the escalator at a speed of `d/36` metres per second. At this speed it takes Aimee 36 seconds to travel the `d` metres up the escalator.
