It’s nearly Christmas, so time for another instalment of your Christmaths challenge paper.

Good luck and happy Chrismaths. Don’t eat too many mince pie charts!

Simon.

Four of these numbers can make two pairs so that each pair adds up to 98,765.  

Which number is the odd one out?

* [ ] 37,373
* [ ] 45,678
* [ ] 53,087
* [ ] 61,392
* [x] 70,082
{.col-3}

---

37,373 + 61,392 = 98,765, and 45,678 + 53,087 = 98,765, so 70,082 is the odd one out.

In March 2003, Welshman Tony Evans dropped a ball from an aircraft a mile above the Mojave desert to see if it would bounce. The ball was made from 6 million rubber bands, had a circumference of 14ft 8in, weighed 2600 pounds and took Mr Evans five years to build.  

On average, roughly how many rubber bands did he add each day while building the ball?

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 33
* [ ] 330
* [x] 3300
* [ ] 33,000
{.col-5}

---

The average number of rubber bands added each day was approximately `6000000/(5 × 365) ≈ 6000000/1800 ≈ 3300`

Four of these points lie on a single straight line. Which is the odd one out?

* [ ] (−3, −3)
* [ ] (−2, −1)
* [x] (2, 5)
* [ ] (4, 11)
* [ ] (5, 13)
{.col-5}

Points (−3, −3), (−2, −1), (4, 11) and (5, 13) all lie on the line whose equation is `y = 2x + 3`, but (2, 5) does not lie on this line.

In the triangle `PQR`, there is a right angle at `Q` and angle `QPR` is 60°.  

The bisector of the angle `QPR` meets `QR` and `S`, as shown.

What is the ratio of `QS` : `SR`?

* [ ] 1 : 1
* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(2)`
* [ ] 1 : (3 - `sqrt(3)`)
* [ ] 1 : `sqrt(3)`
* [x] 1 : 2

Angle PRS = 30°, so triangle PRS is isosceles with SP = SR.  

Hence `(QS)/(SR) = (QS)/(SP) = 1/2` as `PQS` is half of an equilateral triangle.

Alternatively, we can use the angle bisector theorem: `(QS)/(SR) = (PQ)/(PR) = 1/2`as `PQR` is also half of an equilateral triangle.

In the diagram, the letter `S` is made from two arcs, `KL` and `MN`, which are each five-eights of the circumference of a circle of radius 1, and the line segment `LM`, which is tangent to both circles.  

At points `K` and `N`, common tangents to the circles touch one of the circles.  

What is the length `LM`?

* [ ] `3/2`
* [ ] `3 - sqrt(2)`
* [x] `2`
* [ ] `(3 sqrt(2))/2`
* [ ] `1 + sqrt(2)`

Let the centres of the circles be `J` and `O` and let `NI` be the common tangent shown.  

Let `P` be the point of intersection of `JO` and `LM`.  

As arc `KL` is 5/8 of the circumference of the top circle, `∠IJL` = 45°.  

Consider quadrilateral `IJON`: sides `IJ` and `NO` and are radii, so they are both of unit length and they are
both perpendicular to tangent `NI`. So `IJON` is a rectangle.  

Hence `∠IJO = 90°` and `∠LJP = 90° − 45° = 45°`. In triangle `JLP`, `∠JPL = 180° − (90° + 45°) = 45°`.  

So triangle `JLP` is isosceles and `LP = LJ =` 1 unit.

By a similar argument, it may be shown that `PM` is also of length 1 unit, so `LM = LP + PM =` 2 units.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
