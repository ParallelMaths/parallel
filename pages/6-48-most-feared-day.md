*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. 

Millions of people around the world get a bit worried every time Friday 13th comes around, due to long-held superstitions.  

Watch this video to see why, mathematically speaking, there’s no getting away from this date (the good news is there’s nothing to fear about this date):

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ In any given year, what is the least number of times that Friday 13th is guaranteed to occur?

* [ ] 0
* [x] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 12

---

As the video explains, every day of the week accompanies the 13th at least once each year.
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ If Friday 13th lands in January in a non-leap year, when is the next time Friday 13th occurs that year?

* [ ] February
* [ ] June
* [x] October
* [ ] Never

---

For the 13th of each month, we first calculate how many days into the year we are.  

Then we divide by 7 and look at the remainder.  

Each remainder corresponds to a different day of the week.  

October has the same remainder as January (a remainder of 6), so these two months have the same day on the 13th.

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ Which of these is true for a leap year?

* [ ] Friday 13th never occurs
* [ ] Friday 13th always occurs in February
* [ ] Friday 13th always occurs but never in February
* [x] Friday 13th always occurs and it may occur in different months
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ If today is Friday 13th, then what day is it exactly a year from now, assuming that neither this year or next year is a leap year?  

* [ ] Thursday
* [ ] Friday
* [x] Saturday
* [ ] Sunday

^^^ hint id=1_4_1 marks=1
There are 365 days in a (non-leap) year and, when you divide this by 7, the remainder is 1.

There are 365 days in a (non-leap) year and, when you divide this by 7, the remainder is 1.  

So in a year’s time, the same date will have moved on by a single day, which means it will be Saturday.

## 2. Bedtime books and clock puzzles

<!--- PMC (2018) Q3 --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ I start a book, read three-quarters of it at bedtime, and read 22 more pages at breakfast.  

Now I have 35 pages left.  

How many pages are there in the book?  

* [ ] 57
* [ ] 76
* [ ] 114
* [ ] 140
* [x] 228
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
Before breakfast, I had 57 pages left (22 + 35) and one-quarter of the book still to go.
^^^

---

Before breakfast, I had 57 pages left (22 + 35) and one-quarter of the book still to go.  

Therefore, a quarter of the book has 57 pages and the whole book has 4 × 57 = 228 pages.

<!--- PMC (2018) Q16 --->
::: problem id=2_2 marks=2 
__2.2__ What is the time when it is 2018 minutes before midday on Wednesday?

* [ ] 21:38 on Thursday
* [x] 02:22 on Tuesday
* [ ] 14:52 on Tuesday
* [ ] 11:30 on Wednesday
* [ ] 20:18 on Monday

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
2018 minutes is 33 hours and 38 minutes.
^^^

---

We know that 1800 minutes is `1800/60 = 30` hours, 180 minutes is 3 hours, so that 2018 minutes is 33 hours with another 38 minutes remaining.  

So 2018 minutes is equivalent to 1 day, 9 hours and 38 minutes.  

Counting backwards from Wednesday midday gets to Tuesday at 02:22.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
*   This was our last Parallelogram of the year, but be sure to come back in September for more puzzles and problems.

Cheerio,
Simon.
