*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1.
<!--- 1999 (9) --->
::: problem id=1_1 marks=4
__1.1__ It is evening, and Meg, who is 1m tall, casts a shadow of length 3m. If Meg stands on her brother's shoulders, which are 1.5m above the ground, how long a shadow will she and her brother cast?

* [ ] 3m
* [ ] 4.5m
* [ ] 5.5m
* [ ] 6.5m
* [x] 7.5m
{.col-5}

---

The ratio of height to shadow length is 1:3. Their shadow will therefore be 3 × (1 + 1.5) m = 7.5m long.

## 2.
<!--- 1999 (18) --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=4
__2.1__ Seventy pupils (37 boys and 33 girls) are divided into two groups, with forty pupils in Group I and thirty pupils in Group II. How many more boys are there in Group I than there are girls in Group II?

* [ ] 4
* [x] 7
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] more information needed
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1
Let the number of boys in Group I be `x`. The number of girls in Group I is therefore 40 - `x`.  
^^^

---

Let the number of boys in Group I be `x`. The number of girls in Group I is therefore 40 - `x` and the number of girls in Group II is 33 - (40 - `x`) = `x` - 7.  

Therefore there are 7 girls fewer in Group II than there are boys in Group I.

## 3.
<!--- 2000 (1) --->
::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.__ 567 is multiplied by 3489. What is the units digit of the answer?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 3
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

---

Take the units digits of any two numbers and multiply them together. The units digit of the answer is also the units digit of the product of the original numbers. As 7 × 9 = 63, the units digit of 567 × 3489 must also be 3.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ Which type of telescope is less reliant on the quality of the glass?

* [ ] Refractive
* [x] Reflective

## 5.
<!--- 2000 (15) --->
::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ In how many whole numbers between 100 and 999 is the middle digit equal to the sum of the other two digits?

* [ ] 28
* [ ] 36
* [x] 45
* [ ] 50
* [ ] 55
{.col-5}

---

There are 9 such numbers whose first digit is 1 : 110, 121, 132, ..., 187, 198. Similarly there are 8 such numbers, beginning with 220 and ending with 297, whose first digit is 2; 7 such numbers, beginning with 330 and ending with 396, whose first digit is 3 and so on. Lastly there is only 1 such number whose first digit is 9: 990.  

The answer, therefore, is 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45.

And that’s it for this academic year. I hope you’ve enjoyed doing Parallel this year and make sure you come back in September, when we will have another year of Parallelograms.  

But, before that, a few important points.  

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
* This was our last Parallelogram of the year, but be sure to come back in September for more puzzles and problems.

Cheerio,
Simon.
