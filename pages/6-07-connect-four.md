*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. How do you win every time?

Deciding which player should go first, and other strategies for winning is part of a mathematical field called “Game Theory”.

Watch this video of the legendary Brady Haran explaining the strategy to win Connect Four every time!

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1.__ What is the starting strategy which will result in a certain win, if the game is then played perfectly?

* [ ] Start first, place counter in the outer column
* [x] Start first, place counter in the middle column
* [ ] Start first, place counter anywhere
* [ ] Start second, place counter in the outer column
* [ ] Start second, place counter in the middle column

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ There are seven starting moves, from which player two will then place their first counter.  

How many “configurations” could the game be in after each player has made their opening move?

<input type="number" solution="49"/>

---

For each of the seven starting positions player one could chose there are another 7 places player 2 could chose, 7x7 = 49

__1.3.__ The standard connect four grid has 7 rows and 6 columns.  

What is the longest possible diagonal connection which could be made?

## 2. Maths is all fun and games!

Most, if not all, games can be viewed in a Mathematically. Dominos, Noughts and Crosses, and of course Chess can all be misused in a Mathematical way.

Have a go at this domino based puzzle from the 2012 UKMT Junior Challenge.

Dominic wants to place the six dominoes above in a hexagonal ring so that, for every pair of adjacent dominoes, the numbers of pips math.  

The ring on the right indicates how one adjacent pair match.  

In a completed ring, how many of the five dominoes can he definitely _not_ place adjacent to the following domino?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 4

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
