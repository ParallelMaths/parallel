# _Year 7 • Parallelogram 9_ Easter challenges

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Because it is the Easter holidays, this Parallelogram is longer than usual, but you have more time to complete it.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* The next Parallelogram is not until April 20, so there is no need to rush.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations, but only after you have completed the Parallelogram and hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Venn diagrams

This is my all time favourite Venn diagram. What? Doesn’t everyone have favourite Venn Diagram. Anyway …. If you don’t yet have a favourite Venn diagram, then you can borrow this one for the time being. Can you work out the label for the two circles? You can find my answer below.

![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/1-venn-diagram.png){image align="center"}

I guess that the left set contains “creatures with flat tails playing guitars”, while the right set contains “creatures with bills playing keyboards”. Hence, the animal in the overlap is a platypus playing a keytar, because it is a creature with a bill AND a flat tail, which is playing a guitar AND a keyboard.

## Junior Maths Challenge Mock

Some of you will be doing the UKMT’s Junior Maths Challenge next month, so the rest of this Parallelogram consists of 12 Junior Maths Challenge questions – some easy, some tricky. This is an opportunity to get some practice before the real JMC. And, if you are not doing the JMC, then it is an excellent way to develop your maths skills.

In the real JMC, you would have one hour to complete 25 questions, so in theory you have roughly thirty minutes to complete these 12 questions. However, don’t rush, don’t guess and don’t worry if you need longer than thirty minutes … you might even need the full hour.

Here are a few things to bear in mind when you do the real JMC:
* the first half of the questions are not too tricky (__also true below__).
* the second half the questions are really tricky (__also true below__).
* you will lose marks for wrong answers in the second half of the questions (__not true below__).

__We have tried to make our Parallelograms more printer-friendly. In general, it is better to answer questions online, but sometimes (and maybe this is one of those times) it might be worth printing out one or two of the questions, doing them on paper, and then entering your answers back on the screen.__

So don’t take wild guesses for the second half of the questions in the real JMC, and don’t take wild guesses for trickier questions below. However, if you have a rough idea of the answer or have narrowed it down to a couple of possible answers, then it is worth picking an answer.

Finally, afterwards, make sure you go through all the answers and see where you went right and where you went wrong. This is 100% the best way to improve your maths skills.

__The next Parallelogram will contain our usual mix of videos, humour, puzzles and problems.__

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=5
__2.1__ What is half of 1.01?

* [ ] 5.5
* [ ] 0.55
* [x] 0.505
* [ ] 0.5005
* [ ] 0.055
{.col-5}

---

We obtain half of 1.01 by dividing 1.01 by 2. We can do this as a long division sum:

Alternatively, we can use fractions:

`1.01 = 1 + 1/100`. So half of `1.01` is `1/2 + 1/200 = 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505`

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=5
__3.1__ Beatrix looks at the word __JUNIOR__ in a mirror. How many of the reflected letters never look the same as the original, no matter how Beatrix
holds the mirror?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---

The letters J, N and R do not have an axis of symmetry. So these letters cannot look the same when reflected in a mirror, however the mirror is held. The letters U, I and O all have at least one axis of symmetry. So each may look the same when reflected in a mirror.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/4-cubes.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.1__ The diagrams on the right show three different views of the
same cube. Which letter is on the face opposite U?

* [ ] I
* [ ] P
* [ ] K
* [x] M
* [ ] O
{.col-5}

---

From the left hand diagram we see that K is not opposite either I or M, and from the middle diagram that it is not opposite either O or U. Therefore K must be opposite P. So neither K nor P is opposite U. From the middle diagram O is also not opposite U. So U is opposite either I or M. But if U is opposite I, then O must be opposite M, and this possibility is ruled out by the right hand diagram. So U must be opposite to M (and, also, I is opposite O).

## 5

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Tommy Thomas's tankard holds 480 ml when it is one quarter empty. How much does it hold when it is one quarter full?

* [ ] 120 ml
* [x] 160 ml
* [ ] 240 ml
* [ ] 960 ml
* [ ] 1440 ml
{.col-5}

---

When Tommy's tankard is one quarter empty it is three quarters full. So 480 ml is three quarters of the capacity of the tankard. So when it is one quarter full it holds `1/3 (480) = 160` ml.

## 6

::: problem id=6_1 marks=5
![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/7-arrows-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__6.1__ The diagram shows two arrows drawn on separate 4 cm × 4 cm grids.
One arrow points North and the other points West.

When the two arrows are drawn on the same 4 cm × 4 cm grid (still
pointing North and West) they overlap. What is the area of overlap?

* [ ] 4 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 4 `1/2` cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 5 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 5 `1/2` cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 6 cm<sup>2</sup>
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/7-arrows-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
By drawing one arrow on top of the other, as shown, we see that the region
of overlap covers the whole of 4 of the 1 cm × 1 cm squares into which the
grid is divided, and 4 halves of these squares. So the area of the overlapping
region is 4 + 4 (`1/2`) = 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.

## 7

::: problem id=7_1 marks=5
![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/8-l-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__7.1__ Laura wishes to cut this shape, which is made up of nine small squares,
into pieces that she can then rearrange to make a `3 × 3` square.

What is the smallest number of pieces that she needs to cut the shape
into so that she can do this?

* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/8-l-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
In a `3 × 3` square each row and column contains just 3 squares. So none of the pieces that Laura uses to make the square can be more than 3 squares long. It follows that the squares labelled `a` and `b` must be in different pieces, as also must be the squares labelled `b` and `c`. So there must be at least three pieces. The diagrams below show how Laura can fulfill her task using 3 pieces.

## 8

::: problem id=8_1 marks=5
__8.1__ A pattern that repeats every six symbols starts as shown below:

♥ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♥ ♠ ♥ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♥ ♠ ...
{.text-center}

Which are the 100th and 101st symbols, in that order, in the pattern?

* [x] ♦ ♥
* [ ] ♥ ♦
* [ ] ♥ ♣
* [ ] ♠ ♥
* [ ] ♣ ♥
{.col-5}

---

The pattern repeats every 6 symbols. Therefore, as 96 is a multiple of 6, the symbols in positions 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, are the same as those in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, that is, they are ♥ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♥ ♠. We see from this that the symbols that are the 100th and 101st in  list are ♦ ♥, in this order.

## 9

::: problem id=9_1 marks=6
__9.1__ Beth, Carolyn and George love reading their favourite bedtime stories together. They take it in turns to read a page, always in the order Beth, then Carolyn, then George. All twenty pages of the story are read on each occasion. One evening, Beth is staying at Grandma‟s house but Carolyn and George still read the same bedtime story and take it in turns to read a page with Carolyn reading the first page.

In total, how many pages are read by the person who usually reads that page?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 4
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
{.col-5}

---

When all three children are present, Carolyn reads pages 2, 5, 8, ... , that is those pages whose number leaves remainder 2 when divided by 3. George reads pages 3, 6, 9, ... that is, those whose number is a multiple of 3. When Beth stays at Grandma‟s, Carolyn reads pages 1, 3, 5, ... that is the odd numbered pages, and George reads the even numbered pages. So the pages that Carolyn reads both normally and also when Beth is away are those with numbers which have remainder 2 when divided by 3, and are odd. That is, the three pages 5, 11 and 17.

The pages that George reads both normally and also when Beth is away are those with numbers that are multiples of 3 and are even, that is, the three pages 6, 12 and 18. So there are altogether 6 pages which are read by the same person normally and when Beth is away, namely pages 5, 6, 11, 12, 17 and 18.

## 10

::: problem id=10_1 marks=6
![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/11-puzzle.jpg){image align="right"}
__10.1__ The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are to be placed, one per square, in the diagram shown such that the four numbers in the horizontal row add up
to 21 and the four numbers in the vertical column add up to 21.

Which number should replace `x`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [x] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

If we add all the numbers in the horizontal column and all the numbers in the vertical row, we get a total of 21 + 21 = 42 . In doing this sum we add in all the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 once except for `x` which is added in twice. So the total we get is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + `x` = 35 + `x`. Since this equals 42, we must have `x` = 7.

To complete the solution we should check that with `x` = 7, it is possible to place the remaining numbers in the other squares so that the four numbers in the horizontal row add up to 21, and so also do the four numbers in the vertical column.

## 11

::: problem id=11_1 marks=6
__11.1__ Aaron says his age is 50 years, 50 months, 50 weeks and 50 days old. What age will he be on his next birthday?

* [x] 56
* [ ] 55
* [ ] 54
* [ ] 53
* [ ] 51
{.col-5}

---

50 months is 4 years and 2 months. 50 weeks is around 11 `1/2` months and 50 days is about 1 `2/3` months.

So Aaron's age is approximately (50 + 4) years + (2 + 11 `1/2` + 1 `2/3`) months = 54 years + 15 `1/6` months = 55 years and 3 `1/6` months. So he will be 56 on his next birthday.

## 12

::: problem id=12_1 marks=6
![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/13-hexagon-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__12.1__ The diagram shows a design formed by drawing six lines in a regular hexagon. The lines divide each edge of the hexagon into three equal parts.

What fraction of the hexagon is shaded?

* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `2/9`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `3/10`
* [ ] `5/16`
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/7-09-easter-challenges/13-hexagon-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
If we draw in the additional lines shown in the diagram on the right, the hexagon is divided into 54 small congruent equilateral triangles of which 12 are shaded. So the fraction that is shaded is `12/54` = `2/9`.

In fact, it is easier to note that the hexagon can be divided into 6 congruent equilateral triangles, like the one shown with the bold edges.

Each of these is made up of 9 of the small equilateral triangles of which 2 are shaded.

## 13

::: problem id=13_1 marks=6
__13.1__ After playing 500 games, my success rate at Spider Solitaire is 49%. Assuming that I win every game from now on, how many extra games do I need to play in order that my success rate increases to 50%?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 5
* [x] 10
* [ ] 50
{.col-5}

---

Since I have won 49% of my first 500 games, so far I have won `49/100 × = 49 × 5 = 245` games. So I have lost `500 - 245 = 255` games. I need now to win enough games so that I have won as many as I have lost.

So, assuming I win every game from now on, I need to win `255 - 245 = 10` more games.
