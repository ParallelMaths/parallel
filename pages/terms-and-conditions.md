# Data Protection & Terms and Conditions

Good Thinking, as organisers of the Parallel project, are committed to keeping your information secure and managing it in accordance with our legal responsibilities under privacy and data protection laws where we operate.

This Privacy Policy provides information about how we process personal information through Parallel.org.uk.

By visiting our website, you agree to your personal information being used and disclosed in the manner set out in this Policy.

All resources in the Parallel Project are for reasonable use to support teaching and learning within schools/colleges, and individual learners. Parallel resources may not be uploaded to any other website under any circumstances. This includes any site that is only accessible locally such as a school/college virtual learning environment or a school/college intranet.

## The personal information we collect
When you use parallel.org.uk, as is the case with most websites, certain limited information (such as your browser type and IP address) will be collected by us automatically.

We will also collect basic contact information about you to set up your account so you can take part in Parallelogram challenges. This will include:
For students:
*	Name
*	Email address
*	Year of birth
*	Identifying code to link students to their teachers (optional)  

For teachers:
*	Name
*	Email address
*	School name
*	School contact details

We will also ask users to register a password so you can gain secure access to your account in the future.

## How we use personal information
We use the personal information collected from users for:
1.	Enabling users to take part in weekly Parallelogram challenges;
2.	Alerting users to the availability of a new Parallelogram challenge;
3.	Reminding users of Parallelogram challenges to take;
4.	Alerting users to the availability of solutions to the latest Parallelogram challenge;
5.	Contacting winners of sporadic competitions.

We do not provide any personal information to any other organisation relating to your account unless we have your permission to do so (or where we are required to do so by applicable law).

We will only use your information where we have obtained appropriate permissions from you (e.g. with tick boxes) and will only use the information in accordance with this Policy, or where it is required and authorised by law.

From time to time you may be approached to take part in optional surveys which are aimed at enabling Good Thinking to monitor performance, improve quality and plan future provision.

## Keeping information secure
We make every effort to protect your personal information, from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, no internet-based site can be 100% secure and we cannot be held responsible for unauthorised or unintended access that is beyond our control.
