1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each

Welcome to the second of our Parallelograms designed for Year 10 students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons more squiggly.  

These challenges are a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics, most of which will be nothing to do with what you are doing at the moment in your classroom. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas, including a few questions that appear to have nothing to do with mathematics at all.

* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday night if your whole class is doing parallelograms.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then examine the solution sheet to learn from your mistakes.


## 1. Little Big League

In the 1994 film “Little Big League”, a 12-year-old boy called Billy suddenly becomes the manager of the Minnesota Twins baseball team. In this clip, Billy has to solve a maths problem for his homework before he can focus on the rapidly approaching baseball game.

A player comes up with a correct solution, but it is not very well explained, so let’s try a similar problem.  

Suppose Mr Smith can paint the entire house in 12 hours, and Mrs Smith takes just 8 hours to paint the same house. How long would it take the Mr and Mrs Smith working together to paint the house?

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ First, which of the following answers is correct?

* [ ] Working together, they will take even more time than the slower painter.
* [x] Working together, they will take even less time than the faster painter. CORRECT
* [ ] Working together, they will take less time than the slower painter, but more time than the quicker painter.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=4
__1.2.__ How long will it take Mr and Mrs Smith to paint the house if they work together?  

Give your answer in minutes (not hours and minutes).

<input solution="288"/>

^^^ hint id=1_2 marks=1
How much of the house can Mr Smith paint in 1 hour, and how much of the house can Mrs Smith paint in 1 hour? So, working together, how much of the house can they paint in 1 hour?
^^^

---

If it takes Mr Smith 12 hours to paint a house, then he paints `1/12` of a house per hour.  

If it takes Mrs Smith 8 hours to paint a house, then she paints `1/8` of a house per hour.  

Together they paint `1/12 + 1/8 = 5/24` of a house per hour.  

This means they will take `24/5` hours to paint the house.  

(This previous step sometimes makes me scratch my head. Imagine they can paint `1/3` of a house in 1 hour, then it will take them `3/1` (or 3) hours to paint the whole house.)  

`24/5` hours = 4.8 hours = 240 minutes + 48 minutes = 288 minutes.

## 2. Do Unto Caesar

::: problem id=2_1 marks=4
__2.1__ At Caesar's Palace Casino in Vegas, there were three poker players? Alice, Bernie and Craig. At the beginning of the night the amount of money each had was in the ratios 7 : 6 : 5, with Alice starting with the most and Craig the least. At the end of the night, Alice was still ahead and Craig still last, but the money was divided according to the ratio was 6 : 5 : 4.  

This meant that one of the players was up by $12.  

What were the combined assets of the players at the beginning of the evening, in dollars? (No need to put the currency mark in your answer, just put your answer in numbers!)

<input solution="1,080"/>

^^^ hint id=2_1 marks=1
No money entered or left the game. The ratios of how the money was divided changed, but the total amount of money was unchanged.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2_2 marks=1
Turn each set of ratios into fractions.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2_3 marks=1
Bernie still had 1/3 of the money, while Craig lost money, so it must have been Alice who had won the $12.

This problem is from [the terrific NRICH website](https://nrich.maths.org/){target="_blank"}, a treasure of mathematical ideas and questions. Go and explore.  

`7 : 6 : 5 = 7/18 : 6/18 : 5/18`  
`6 : 5 : 4 = 6/15 : 5/15 : 4/15`   

The lowest common multiple of 15 and 18 is 90, so  

`35/90 : 30/90 : 25/90`  
`36/90 : 30/90 : 24/90`  

We can see that Craig lost `1/90` of the money and Alice gained it. We are told that the sum of money gained is $12. Therefore 1/90 of the money = $12.  

Therefore the total amount of money is 90 × $12 = $1,080.

## 3.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2016) Q2 --->

Every Parallelogram will contain two or more UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge problems. This first one is fairly simple, but others will be much trickier... and for all of them, remember, NO CALCULATORS!

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
Which of the following fractions is closest to 1?

* [ ] `7/8`
* [ ] `8/7`
* [ ] `9/10`
* [x] `10/11`
* [ ] `11/10`
{.col-5}

---

We tackle this question by calculating the differences between the given options and 1.  

We have `1 − 7/8 = 1/8`,  
`8/7 − 1 = 1/7`,   
`1 − 9/10 = 1/10`,  
`1 − 10/11 = 1/11`, and  
`11/10 − 1 = 1/10`.  

The smallest of these differences is `1/11`.  

Therefore, of the given options, `10/11` is closest to 1.

## 4.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2016) Q9 --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
The world’s fastest tortoise is acknowledged to be a leopard tortoise from County Durham called Bertie. In July 2014, Bertie sprinted along a 5.5m long track in an astonishing 19.6 seconds.  

What was Bertie’s approximate average speed in km per hour? Remember, NO CALCULATOR!

* [ ] 0.1
* [ ] 0.5
* [x] 1
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 10
{.col-5}

---
It took Bertie 19.6 seconds to travel 5.5m. So Bertie went `(5.5)/(19.6)` m in 1 second. There are 3600 seconds in one hour. Therefore Bertie travelled

`(5.5)/(19.6) × 3600` m in one hour.  

There are 1000m in 1 km. Therefore Bertie’s average speed in km per hour was  

`(5.5)/(19.6) × 3600/1000 = (5.5)/(19.6) × 18/5`.  

This is approximately equal to  

`5/18 × 18/5 = 1`.  

Therefore Bertie’s approximate average speed was 1 km per hour.

I hope you enjoyed the second Parallelogram of the year. There will be more next week, and the week after, and the week after that. So check your email or return to the website on Thursday at 3pm.

In the meantime, you can find out your score, the answers and go through the answer sheet as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button below.

When you see your % score, this will also be your reward score. As you collect more and more points, you will collect more and more badges. Find out more by visiting the Rewards Page after you hit the SUBMIT button.

It is really important that you go through the solution sheet. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important than what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something new.

Cheerio,
Simon.
