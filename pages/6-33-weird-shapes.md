*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. The Klein Bottle

Watch this video where mathematical treasure, Cliff Stoll, shows us a very unusual shape. He actually stores hundreds of these shapes under his house!

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ Two equally sized triangles have 6 edges in total.  

If they are glued together to form a new shape how many edges would it have?

## 2. Some curious puzzles

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Think of a positive number, multiply it by 5, add 1, double what you have, take away 2, and divide by the number you first thought of.  

What answer did you get?  

* [ ] 5
* [x] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] can't tell
{.col-5}

---

Regardless of what number you thought of in to begin with, the answer will be 10.  

Try it on your friends!

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ How many regular hexagons are in this diagram?

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
