# Top-Top Set

The Top-Top Set (TTS) project is running a pilot in two secondary schools in Newham and two schools in SE England. The aim of the pilot and the project overall is to maximise the potential of numerate and ambitious students (starting in Year 7), by nurturing and challenging them until they leave school for higher education. Students involved in the project should be aiming beyond A* at A level, so that they are able to earn places on STEM degree courses at the best universities, and are then able to thrive as undergraduates. 
 
If the pilot is successful, the aim is to grow the project rapidly. Our aspiration is that the TTS is available in all schools, thereby significantly increasing the number of high-performing STEM students, particularly from groups who have been previously underrepresented.
 
The TTS project was started by author [Simon Singh](http://www.simonsingh.net/) and the charity [Good Thinking](http://www.goodthinkingsociety.org/). 

The Newham part of the project is being co-ordinated by Matthew Squire at Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre.
