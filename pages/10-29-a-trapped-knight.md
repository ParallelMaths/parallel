## 1. A Trapped Knight

This is a fascinating Numberphile video presented by mathematical genius Neil Sloane. Although it relates to the knight in chess, you don’t need to know anything about chess, except that the knight moves in an L-shape, which means moving 2 squares in a line, then a turn by 90o, and moving one more square, as shown by the dots on this chessboard.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ The knight dashes around the infinite board according to the rules outlined by Neil Sloane, and it eventually gets trapped at square 2,084.  

On its way to this square, it does move through all the smaller numbered squares. What is the smallest numbered square that is not visited by the knight?

## 2. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2005) Q5 --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ How many of the following statements are true?

- Any number which is divisible by 6 is even.  
- Any number which is divisible by 9 is odd.  
- The sum of any two odd numbers is even.  
- The sum of any two even numbers is odd.  

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

If a number is divisible by 6 then it must also be divisible by 2, so is even. ‘The sum of any two odd numbers is even’ is also true. However, not all multiples of 9 are odd (e.g. 18) and the sum of any two even numbers is even rather than odd, so two of the four statements are true.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__ To make porridge, Goldilocks mixes together 3 bags of oats with 1 bag containing 20% wheat bran and 80% oats.  

All the bags have the same volume. What percentage of the volume of Goldilocks' porridge mixture is wheat bran?

* [x] 5%  
* [ ] 6 `2/3`%  
* [ ] 20%
* [ ] 26 `2/3`%
* [ ] 60%
{.col-5}

---

Four bags of porridge contain one-fifth of a bag of wheat bran. So the proportion of wheat bran in the porridge is `1/20`, that is 5%.

<!--- (2005) Q19 --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=5
__19.1__ Trinni is fascinated by triangle numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.) and recently, coming across a clock, she found that she could rearrange the twelve numbers 1, 2, 3, … 12 around the face so that each adjacent pair added up to a triangle number.  

She left the 12 in its usual place; what number did she put where the 6 would usually be?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11

For ease of reference, label the points A, B, C,…, K as shown.  

First note that A = 3 and K = 9 or vice versa. With no loss of generality, let A = 3. Then the only possible values for B, C, and D are 7, 8 and 2 respectively. This gives E = 1 or 4 and, as K = 9, J = 1 or 6.  

If J = 1, then E = 4 and the only remaining possibilities for I, H and G are 5, 10 and 11 respectively.  

This means that F = 6, but 11 + 6 is not a triangle number, so J is not 1 and must, therefore, be 6. This means that
I = 4 and hence E = 1.  

The remaining values may now be assigned: H = 11, G = 10 and F = 5.

Another puzzle from Professor Wiseman, [whose website is worth a visit](https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/){target="_blank"} when you’ve completed this Parallelogram.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ What letter comes next in this sequence?  

__W__, __L__, __C__, __N__, __I__, __T__, _

<input solution="S"/>

## 6. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2005) Q6 --->

::: problem id=6_1 marks=3
__6.1__ A shop advertises ‘Buy one, get one at half price’. For this offer, the average cost per item is the same as:

* [ ] Two for the price of one  
* [ ] Three for the price of one  
* [ ] Three for the price of two  
* [x] Four for the price of three  
* [ ] Five for the price of four  
{.col-5}

---

The offer gives the purchaser two items for the price of one and a half items.  

So the average cost per item is the same as four items for the price of three.

There will be more next week, so check your email or return to the website on Thursday at 3pm.  

In the meantime, you can find out your score, the answers and go through the answer sheet as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button below.

When you see your % score, this will also be your reward score. As you collect more and more points, you will collect more and more badges. Find out more by visiting the Rewards Page after you hit the SUBMIT button.

It is really important that you go through the solution sheet. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important than what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something new.

Cheerio,
