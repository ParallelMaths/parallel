* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday night if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

__1.1__ What is half of 1.01?

* [ ] 5.5
* [ ] 0.55
* [x] 0.505
* [ ] 0.5005
* [ ] 0.055
{.col-5}

We obtain half of 1.01 by dividing 1.01 by 2. We can do this as a long division sum, or alternatively, we can use fractions:

`1.01 = 1 + 1/100`. So half of `1.01` is `1/2 + 1/200 = 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505`

__2.1__ Laura wishes to cut this shape, which is made up of nine small squares, into pieces that she can then rearrange to make a `3 × 3` square.

What is the smallest number of pieces that she needs to cut the shape into so that she can do this?

In a `3 × 3` square each row and column contains just 3 squares. So none of the pieces that Laura uses to make the square can be more than 3 squares long. It follows that the squares labelled `a` and `b` must be in different pieces, as must be the squares labelled `b` and `c`. So there must be at least three pieces. The diagrams below show how Laura can fulfill her task using 3 pieces.

__3.1__ How many minutes are there from 11:11 until 23:23 on the same day?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 720

The time difference is 12 hours and 12 minutes, that is 732 minutes.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=6
__4.1__ Only one of the following statements is true. Which one?

* [ ] A ‘B is true’  
* [ ] B ‘E is false’  
* [ ] C ‘Statements A to E are true’  
* [ ] D ‘Statements A to E are false’  
* [x] E ‘A is false’  

---

For statement A to be true, B would also have to be true. But we are told that only one statement is true, so this is not possible. We deduce that statement A is false. Therefore statement E is true.  

In the context of the JMC you could stop here, because we have found one statement that must be true. However, we really ought to satisfy ourselves that statement E is the only one that is true.  

As statement E is true, statement B is false. Statement D can never be true, because if statement D were true, all the statements, including D, would be false, and we would have a contradiction. Because statement D must be false, statement C cannot be true.  

So statement E is true and all the other statements are false.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=6
__5.1__ Aaron says his age is 50 years, 50 months, 50 weeks and 50 days old. What age will he be on his next birthday?

* [x] 56
* [ ] 55
* [ ] 54
* [ ] 53
* [ ] 51
{.col-5}

---

50 months is 4 years and 2 months. 50 weeks is around 11 `1/2` months and 50 days is about 1 `2/3` months.

So Aaron's age is approximately (50 + 4) years + (2 + 11 `1/2` + 1 `2/3`) months = 54 years + 15 `1/6` months = 55 years and 3 `1/6` months. So he will be 56 on his next birthday.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
