## 1. Winter Olympics Puzzle (A)

__Every four years, the world’s leading winter athletes – the skiers, skaters,
sledders and snowboarders – gather to compete for medals in the Winter Olympic
Games. In 2018, the games have been taking place in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Of course, among the drama, bravery and triumph, there is plenty of room for
maths! So, while you’re cheering on your favourites, don’t miss the chance to
tackle these Winter Olympics maths puzzles.__

The Jamaican bobsled team was one of the most famous feel-good stories of the
1988 Games in Calgary. Jamaica’s Caribbean climate is not the most helpful for
bobsledding, but the team borrowed equipment and asked for help. While the
four-man bob team was unplaced after crashing in qualifying, the two-man team
finished a creditable 30th out of 41. The movie _Cool Runnings_ is – very
loosely – based on their experience.

In the bobsled (or bobsleigh), teams of two or four pack into a streamlined
sled and slide down a twisting, icy course with steep, banked corners as fast
as they possibly can – often as fast as 75mph. It gets its name from early
competitors who realised they could go faster by bobbing back and forth inside
the sled!

The 2010 Winter Olympics at Whistler, Canada, took place on a track 1,450
metres long. Each team had four runs at the course, and the winners were the
team with the smallest total time.

__Feel free to use a calculator for these puzzles!__

Canada were in second place with total time of 3 minutes, 24.85 seconds –
but Germany, in third place, still had one run to go.

In the first three heats, Germany had a total time of 2 minutes, 33.48
seconds.

How quickly, in seconds, did the German team have to complete their final run
to win at least a share of the silver medal?

<input type="number" solution="51.37"/> seconds  

---

3:24.85 is 204.85 seconds; 2:33:48 is 153.48 seconds. The difference, and
target time, is 51.37 seconds. In fact, Germany’s final heat time was 51:36!

record.

What was their average speed in metres per second? Remember, the track was
1,450 metres long

Can you convert that to miles per hour? (Note: there are 1,609.344 metres in a
mile.)

<input type="number" solution="28.51"/> m/s  
<input type="number" solution="63.77"/> mph  

---

1,450m in 50.86s is 1450÷50.86 = 28.51m/s. In 3,600 seconds, they would travel
about 102,636 metres, so they’re moving at 102,636 metres per hour. Dividing
this by 1,609.344 gives 63.77mph.

## 2. Winter Olympic Puzzle (B)

The most famous ski jumper in history is not exactly famous for being good.
Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards, self-funded and short-sighted, famously finished in
last place in both the 70m and 90m events at Calgary, Canada in 1988, scoring
fewer than half as many points as his nearest competitor. However, these
scores are still the British records for ski-jumping! In 2016, a film of his
exploits, _Eddie The Eagle_, was released.

![](/resources/7-05-downhill-from-here/2-ski-jump.jpg){image align="center"}

In the ski jump, competitors ski down a huge ramp, reaching speeds of up to
60mph before jumping as far down the hill as they possibly can.

Each jump is awarded points based on two factors: the distance jumped, and the
jumper’s style.

Here is the recipe (we've simplified it a bit for this puzzle!):

* Take 60 metres away from the distance jumped (this could be a negative
number!)
* Double the result
* Add on the style score.

A group of judges also awards up to 60 points for style – how well the jumper
flies and lands.

For example, to work out the score for a ski jumper who jumped 95 metres with
enough grace to pick up 40 style points, you would calculate:

95 – 60 =  35  
35 ×  2 =  70  
70 + 40 = 110  
{.text-center}  

...so the jump would be worth 110 points.

Similarly, a jumper who manages 80 metres with 25 style points would score 65
points altogether.

Albania) jumps exactly 90 metres and scores a perfect 60 for style. How many

60 for distance, 60 for style = 120 altogether

Kazakhstan) jumps 95 metres and scores a total of 120 points. How many style
points was she awarded?

<input type="number" solution="50"/>   

---

She has 70 for distance, so must have another 50 for style.

including no style points at all. How far did he jump?

<input type="number" solution="60"/> metres

To get 0 points for distance, Lemmy must have jumped exactly 60 metres.

this video that explains how to be a ski jump champion... and then answer this
question.

## 4. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (14)

![](/resources/7-05-downhill-from-here/4-cuboid.png){image align="right"} The
diagram shows a cuboid in which the area of the shaded face is one-quarter of
the area of each of the two visible unshaded faces. The total surface area of
the cuboid is 72 cm².

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1__ What, in cm², is the area of one of the visible unshaded faces of the
cuboid?

* [x] 16
* [ ] 28.8
* [ ] 32
* [ ] 36
* [ ] 48
{.col-5}

---

Let the area of the shaded face be χcm². Then each of the visible unshaded
faces has area 4χcm². Hence the total surface area of the cuboid in cm² is
2(4χ + 4χ + χ) = 18χ.

So 18x = 72. Therefore χ = 4, and the area of one of the visible shaded faces,
in cm² is 4χ =  16.

## 5. The affine cipher

Over the last couple of weeks, we discussed how you can encode a message by
turning each letter into a number according to the alphabet-number pairings
below, and either (1) adding a fixed value to each letter-number or (2)
multiplying each letter-number by a fixed value. The result is then turned
back into a letter.  

| 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
{.grid}

| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
{.grid}

The affine cipher used both multiplication and addition to encipher a letter,
word or whole message. For example, let’s multiply each letter in the message
(M) by 5 and then add 2 to get each letter in the code (C). We could say:

C = (5 × M) + 2{.text-center}  

Let’s apply this affine cipher to the word CAB. If we turn this into numbers,
we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.  

If we multiply by 5 and add 2, we obtain 12 ¦ 2 ¦ 7.  

__If we translate back into letters, the code is MCH.__

Now, let’s encipher the same word, but this time we will change the affine
cipher so that we multiply by 9 and add 10:

C = (9 × M) + 10{.text-center}  

CAB. If we turn this into numbers, we obtain 2 ¦ 0 ¦ 1.  

If we multiply by 9 and add 10, we obtain 28 ¦ 10 ¦ 19.  

Remember, we cannot have numbers bigger than 25, so we subtract 26 from any
problematic numbers, so that 28 becomes 2. So, the new letter sequence is 3 ¦
10 ¦ 19.  

__If we translate back into letters, the code is DKT.__  

If you are confused (perhaps you missed some of the earlier Parallelograms),
then take look at [this video from Chris at Chegg.com](Chegg.com){target="_blank"}. The explanation is
fairly slow and lengthy, but it should clear up any confusion.

Now that you have mastered the affine cipher, answer these questions.

## 6. Amazing James Randi and psychic surgery

A couple of weeks ago, you watched the Amazing James Randi perform some
escapology. Today, he is back again, this time performing some psychic surgery:
*	This video is bloody, so __don’t watch it if you are squeamish__.
*	Psychic surgery is fake, but some people believe it is real.
*	People waste time, money and hope visiting psychic surgeons.
*	See if you can work out how Randi performs his fake surgery.
*	__Really, don’t watch it if you are squeamish!__

## Additional Stuff

* Here is [a website that implements the affine cipher](https://cryptii.com/affine-cipher){target="_blank"}. You can change
the multiplication number (labelled “Slope / A”) and the added number
(labelled “Intercept / B”). You can check some of your answers above or just
play around with encrypting messages. If you adjust the multiplication number,
you will notice that some numbers are not allowed – can you remember why this
is the case?

* Here is [another clip featuring the Amazing James
Randi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CASghTzNhc&t=0m25s){target="_blank"},
in which he tests someone who claims he can move objects with the power of his
mind. I think this clip is terrific because it shows how a bit of clever
thinking can create a test that demonstrates that this psychic has no special
powers. First you will see the fake psychic (I should add that all psychics
are fake), and then your will see Randi’s clever test.
