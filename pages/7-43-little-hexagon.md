*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. The largest small hexagon

What does it mean for a shape to be small? And how can one be the largest small shape?  

Don’t worry, Dr. James Grime is here to show us this quirky little hexagon.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What does it mean for a shape to be “small”?

* [ ] It can’t be seen by the human eye
* [x] It has diagonal length 1
* [ ] It has fewer than 7 sides
* [ ] There exists a shape which is bigger than it

__1.2__ How much larger is the largest small hexagon’s area compared to the regular hexagon?

* [ ] Twice as big
* [x] 4% larger
* [ ] 50% larger
* [ ] `7/6` of the size

__1.3__ Using the fact that the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 50cm is around 1082cm<sup>2</sup>.  

Find the area of this hexagon with diagonal 1m (100cm).  

* [ ] 180 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 6492 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 3246 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 541 cm<sup>2</sup>

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1 
Think about how many equilateral triangles would fit inside the hexagon.

## 2. Angle Tangle

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ The diagram shows a regular hexagon with an equilateral triangle inside it.  

What is the size of the marked angle?

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
Consider two useful facts:  

All three angles in a triangle total 180°.

All six angles in a hexagon total 720°.

__2.2__ The diagonals of a hexagon split the shape into 13 pieces.  

What fraction of the whole shape is the hexagonal piece in the center?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [x] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/5`

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
