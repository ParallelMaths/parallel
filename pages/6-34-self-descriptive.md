*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. What's your favourite Mega-Large Number?

Stand up mathematician, Matt Parker, put out a call for people’s favourite mega-large numbers.  

Check out this response from Maths Teacher Chris Smith.  

Can he convince you that this is one of the best large numbers out there?

__1.1__ What number is missing from this seven digit self-descriptive number?  

__321_000__

* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

![](/resources/6-34-self-descriptive/7-digit.jpg){image align="center"}  

The missing number was in the "how many 3s column" and there is one 3 in the number.  

So the full self-descriptive number is 3211000  

* 3 zeros  
* 2 ones  
* 1 two  
* 1 three  
* 0 fours  
* 0 fives  
* 0 sixes  

So neat!

__1.2__ Which of these numbers also has the self- descriptive property?  

* [ ] 1100
* [x] 21200
* [ ] 2002
* [ ] 123332

__1.3__ Can you find an eight digit self-descriptive number?  

Some of the digits are given to help you get started.  

![](/resources/6-34-self-descriptive/8-digit-1.jpg){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="4210100"/> 

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1
Since the number starts with a 4, we know there are four 0s to be placed.  

The position of the one lets us know that there is a 2 which needs to be placed.  

There is also at least one 4, so we can update the “how many 4s” column.  

![](/resources/6-34-self-descriptive/8-digit-2.jpg){image align="center"}

Now try to place the four 0s and the 2 in a way that keeps it self descriptive.

## 2. Some curiosities

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Maisie was telling me her mobile phone number but she sneezed in the middle.  

She said it was divisible by 9.  

I got her number as: 07922?03441.  

Which of these numbers could replace the unknown number?  

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 0
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
If a number is divisible by 9 then the sum of it's digits is also divisible by 9.  

Try adding up the digits and see how much more you would need to reach a multiple of 9.

__2.2__
A number could be called self-descriptive for another reason, namely if the number has the same number of letters as the number itself.  

Which is the only self-descriptive number according to this definition?  

It is not ONE, because it has three letters, not one letter.  

And it is not TWELVE, because it has six letters, not twelve letters.  

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 7

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
