*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Prime Reciprocals

Primes, famously, can only be divided equally by 1 and themselves - but what happens if you divide 1 by a prime?  

Watch this video where Matt Parker spends a day in the Royal Society archives getting to the bottom of this mystery.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What happens (usually) when you divide 1 by a prime number?  

* [ ] The result is a whole number  
* [x] It creates an infinitely looping decimal  
* [ ] It creates a decimal which is infinitely long and never repeats  
* [ ] The universe implodes  
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ There are two prime numbers which are exceptions to this rule, what are they?  

* [ ] 1 and 11
* [ ] 47 and 51
* [x] 2 and 5
* [ ] 47 and 53
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ How long is the repeating part of `1/13`?  

* [ ] 5 digits
* [x] 6 digits
* [ ] 7 digits
* [ ] It doesn’t repeat
{.col-5}

---

When 1 is divided by 13 the answer is 0.076923076923076923...  

You can see the string 076923 repeats and so the period of `1/13` is 6 digits.

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ We know that `1/7` gives a repeating decimal, but what about `2/7`?  

Try to find it without a calculator.  

* [ ] 0.142857
* [ ] 0.428571
* [x] 0.285714
* [ ] 0.857142
{.col-5}

---

With prime reciprocals the different numerators cycle through a pattern on the denominator.  

Look:
* `1/7` = 0.142857
* `3/7` = 0.428571
* `2/7` = 0.285714
* `6/7` = 0.857142
* `4/7` = 0.571428
* `5/7` = 0.714285

## 2. In your prime
This is only the start of the fun properties of primes.  

For the next two questions, it helps to know the prime numbers up to 100.  

![](/resources/6-27-prime-time/2-prime-hundred-square.png){image align="center"}

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Add up the first 9 primes to find a satisfying result!  

* [x] Its a square number  
* [ ] Its also a prime  
* [ ] Its a single digit recurring  
* [ ] Its a palindromic number  

---

The sum of the first 9 primes is:  

2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 100   

Look at this satisfying visual proof:

::: problem id=2_2 marks=3
__2.2__ Square numbers like 100 can even be made by adding just two primes e.g. 97 + 3 = 100.  

How many different pairs of prime add for a total of 100?  

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 4
* [x] 6
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
It may help to look at a list of all the prime numbers up to 100.  

Then try to pair them up to make 100.  

Here are two examples:  

* 3 + 97 = 100  
* 11 + 89 = 100  

The question is asking __how many__ prime pairs can make 100.
^^^

---

Here are all of the possibilities for adding exactly two primes to total 100:  

* 97 + 3
* 89 + 11
* 83 + 17
* 71 + 29
* 59 + 41
* 53 + 47

In fact, all square numbers up to 100 can be made by adding two primes together - try a few yourself!

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
