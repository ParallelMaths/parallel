## 1. Can you light a match with water?

Watch the video below - there will be a question to follow it:

__2.1__ If the net shown is folded to make a cube, which letter is opposite X?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [x] D
* [ ] E

---

Let X be on the top face of the cube. If the base is placed on a horizontal surface, then A, B, C, E will all be on vertical faces of the cube and D will be on the base, opposite X.

__3.1.__ In the diagram on the right, `ST` is parallel to `UV`.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 46
* [ ] 48
* [x] 86
* [ ] 92
* [ ] 94

As `ST` is parallel to `UV`, `∠PRT = 132°` (corresponding angles).

So `∠PRQ = 48°` (angles on a straight line).

From the exterior angle of a triangle theorem, `∠SQP = ∠QPR + ∠PRQ`, so `x = 134 - 48 = 86°`.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ In the following expression each ▲ is to be replaced with either + or - in such a way that the result of the calculation is 100.

123 ▲ 45 ▲ 67 ▲ 89  
{.text-center}

The number of + signs used is `p` and the number of - signs used is `m`. What is the value of `p` - `m` ?

* [ ] -3
* [x] -1
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3

One approach is trial and error, as there are only a few combinations. For example, if it is (+ 45) then it is hard to see how we obtain a result of 100. So, we can then explore (- 45). Following this approach quickly leads you to the correct answer, but there is also a more rigorous and mathematical approach.

The sum is made up of 123 and ± 45, ± 67and ± 89. Suppose that the total of the positive terms in the calculation is `x` and the total of the negative terms is `y`. So `x > 0` and `y < 0`. We need to have that:

`x + y = 100`.
{.text-center}

We also have that:

`x - y = 123 + 45 + 67 + 89 = 324`.
{.text-center}

Adding these equations, we obtain `2x = 424`. So `x = 212` and hence `y = -112`. It is readily seen that `45 + 67 = 112` and that no other combination of 45, 67 and 89 gives a total of 112. So the correct calculation must be `123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100` with 1 plus sign and 2 minus signs. So `p = 1` and
`m = 2`, giving `p - m = -1`.

__5.1__ A 6 by 8 and a 7 by 9 rectangle overlap with one corner coinciding as shown.

What is the area (in square units) of the region outside the overlap?

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 21
* [x] 27
* [ ] 42
* [ ] 69

The two shaded regions measure 3 by 7 and 1 by 6, so the total area outside the overlap is 27 units<sup>2</sup>.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
