1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. When do clock hands overlap?

It's always a good time to think about clocks! Both analogue and digital clocks are fascinating in their own ways.  

Watch this video where mathematical treasure, Cliff Stoll, asks a question to get the cogs turning.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1.__ How many times do the hands of a clock cross in 12 hours?

<input type="number" solution="11"/>
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ The time between each crossing is 1hr 5mins and 27 seconds (to the nearest second).  

What time is the last hand crossing of the day?

* [ ] 10.55pm and 33 seconds
* [ ] 11.05pm and 27 seconds
* [x] 10.54pm and 33 seconds
* [ ] 10.54pm and 83 seconds

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3.__ This addition square has something unusual about it.  

What number should be in the missing square?

<input type="number" solution="10"/>

Some of the squares give unexpected results, e.g. 11 + 3 is normally 14 but here we have 2.

8 + 8 usually gives 16 but instead we have 4.

After 12 the numbers start to “go round again”, just like on a 24 hour clock.

This is called modular arithmetic, and in this case in particular modulo 12.

11 + 11 = 22, but modulo 12 would give 10, just as 22.00 is 10 o’clock.

## 2. A glitch in time

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ Leap years occur when the year is divisible by 4, or 400, but not if they are divisible by 100.  

Which of these years was not a leap year?

* [ ] 2000
* [ ] 1832
* [x] 2200
* [ ] 1992
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2.__ If someone was born on the 29th February 2020, and celebrated their birthday exactly 365 days later - which date would their first birthday land on?

* [x] 28th February 2021
* [ ] 29th February 2021
* [ ] 1st March 2021
* [ ] 2nd March 2021

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
