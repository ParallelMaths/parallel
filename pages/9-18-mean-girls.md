## 1. Mean Girls

Here’s a clip from “Mean Girls”, a 2004 film starring Lindsay Lohan as Cady, a student trying to settle into a new school. Cady tries to change herself in order to fit in, but in the end she returns to her original personality and joins the Mathletes in the state championship finals.

Cady answers a question about “limits”, which is something you probably haven't covered yet.  

The concept of limits touches on areas such as finding the value of a function in unusual or extreme situations. For example, let’s explore the value of this function.

`(2z^2 - 17z + 8)/(8 - z)`
{.text-center}

When `z = 7`,  then `f(z) = -13`.  

When `z = 9`,  then `f(z) = -17`.  

But what about when `z = 8`?  

The denominator is `(8 – 8)`, which is zero, and we cannot divide by zero. So what is the answer? Is there an answer?  

We can factor the top half of the equation, so it can be re-written as:

`(2z^2 - 17z + 8)/(8 - z) = ((2z - 1)(z - 8))/(-(z - 8)) = (2z - 1)/(-1)`
{.text-center}

Now it is clear that when `z = 8`, then `f(z) = -15`.  

Now, answer the question below, which relate to the function:

`(y^2 - 4y - 21)/(y - 7)`
{.text-center}

`(y^2 - 4y - 21)/(y - 7) = ((y - 7)(y + 3))/(y - 7) = y + 3 = 10`

## 2. Demis Hassabis

Demis Hassabis is an extraordinary computer scientist, perhaps the greatest pioneer in artificial intelligence in the world. He grew up in North London, the son of a Chinese-Singaporean mother and Greek-Cypriot father, and went to his local comprehensive school.  

In this short interview, he explains how chess played an important role in his development. Take a look and maybe think about starting to learn how to play chess. Or, if you play chess already, start taking it more seriously and join a chess club.

By the way, there are several great online websites, many of them offering free interactive lessons or the chance to play other people online (or play against a computer). A good place to start is [Chess Kid](https://www.chesskid.com/){target="_blank"}.


## 3. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2011 (25) --->

This is one of the toughest questions from a UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge exam, so be ready to stretch your brain.

::: problem id=3 marks=4
![](/resources/9-18-mean-girls/3-square.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1__  The diagram shows a square, a diagonal and a line joining a vertex to the midpoint of a side. What is the ratio of area `P` to area `Q`?

* [ ] `1 : sqrt(2)`
* [ ] `2 : 3`
* [ ] `1 : 2`
* [x] `2 : 5`
* [ ] `1 : 3`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=1 marks=2
![](/resources/9-18-mean-girls/3-square-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
Let `I`, `J`, `K` and `L` be the vertices of the square. Let `M` be the midpoint of `JK`, let N be the point where the diagonal `IK` meets `LM`. Let the line through `N` parallel to `LK` meet `IL` at `R` and `JK` at `S`. Let `T` be the foot of the perpendicular from `N` to `LK`. Let the square have side length `s`.

In the triangles `INL` and `KNM`, the opposite angles `∠INL` and `∠KNM` are equal. Also, as IL is parallel to `JK`, the alternate angles `∠LIN` and `∠MKN` are equal. Therefore the triangles `INL` and `KNM` are similar. Hence `IN/NK = IL/MK = 2`.

Similarly, the triangles INR and KNS are similar. Therefore `NR/NS = IN/NK = 2`.

So `NR = 2/3 s` and `NS = 1/3 s`.

Let `I`, `J`, `K` and `L` be the vertices of the square. Let `M` be the midpoint of `JK`, let N be the point where the diagonal `IK` meets `LM`. Let the line through `N` parallel to `LK` meet `IL` at `R` and `JK` at `S`. Let `T` be the foot of the perpendicular from `N` to `LK`. Let the square have side length `s`.

In the triangles `INL` and `KNM`, the opposite angles `∠INL` and `∠KNM` are equal. Also, as IL is parallel to `JK`, the alternate angles `∠LIN` and `∠MKN` are equal. Therefore the triangles `INL` and `KNM` are similar. Hence `IN/NK = IL/MK = 2`.

Similarly, the triangles INR and KNS are similar. Therefore `NR/NS = IN/NK = 2`.

So `NR = 2/3 s` and `NS = 1/3 s`.

Now, `NTKS` is square, because its angles are all right-angles, and `∠NKT = 45°`. Therefore `NT = NS = 1/3 s`.

It follows that the area of the triangles LNK, INL and MNK are `1/2 (s × 1/3 s) = 1/6 s^2`, `1/2 (s × 2/3 s) = 1/3 s^2`, and `1/2 (1/2 s × 1/3 s) = 1/12 s^2`, respectively.  

The area of the region P, is that of the triangle LNK, that is, `1/6 s^2`. The area of the region Q is obtained by subtracting the areas of the triangles LNK, INL and MNK from the area of the square. So region Q has area `s^2 - 1/6 s^2 - 1/3 s^2 - 1/12 s^2 = 5/12 s^2`.  

So the ratio of these areas is `1/6 s^2 : 5/12 s^2 = 1/6 : 5/12 = 2 : 5`.

## 4. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)

::: problem id=4 marks=2
__4.1__  Which of the following is divisible by 6?

* [ ] one million minus one
* [ ] one million minus two
* [ ] one million minus three
* [x] one million minus four
* [ ] one million minus five
{.col-3}

---

It helps to first write the options we are given in standard form using digits:  

* 999 999
* 999 998
* 999 997
* 999 996
* 999 995

An integer is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 2 and by 3. It is easy to see that, of the given options, only 999 998 and 999 996 are divisible by 2, and, of these, only 999 996 is divisible by 3.

## 5. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2013 (2) --->

::: problem id=5 marks=2
__5.1__  A machine cracks open 180 000 eggs per hour. How many eggs is that per second?

* [ ] 5
* [x] 50
* [ ] 500
* [ ] 5000
* [ ] 50000
{.col-5}

---

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So there are 60 × 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

So 180 000 eggs per hour is the same as `180000/3600 = 1800/36 = 50` eggs per second.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
