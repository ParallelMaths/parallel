*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Dividing by zero

There are lots of rules which help us understand mathematics, but maths is as much about breaking rules as it is about making rules.  

There is, however, one rule in maths which must never be broken: don’t divide by zero!  

But why?! Watch this video to find out:

__1.1__ Which of these sums would result in the biggest answer?  

* [ ] `36 ÷ 12`
* [ ] `36 ÷ 2`
* [ ] `36 ÷ 1/2`
* [x] `36 ÷ 1/4`

__1.2__ Which of these statements is correct for positive numbers?

* [x] The smaller the divisor the bigger the answer
* [ ] The smaller the divisor the smaller the answer`
* [ ] The bigger the divisor the bigger the answer

__1.3__ If I have a number and multiply it by 3, what must I do to return to the original number?  

* [ ] - 3
* [ ] × 3
* [x] × `1/3`
* [ ] ÷ `1/3`
{.col-5}

---

Multiplying by `1/3` is the same as dividing by 3.  

So 3 and `1/3` are “multiplicative inverses”.  

To undo × 3 you could ÷ 3 or  you could × `1/3`.

::: problem id=1_4 marks=1
__1.4__ What happens when you multiply a number by it's multiplicative inverse?

* [ ] You can’t do this  
* [x] The answer is always 1  
* [ ] The answer is always 0  
* [ ] The answer is always infinity  

---

Multiplying a number by it's inverse always results in 1, eg:   

* `2 × 1/2 = 1`  
* `3 × 1/3 = 1`  
* `4 × 1/4 = 1`  
* `12345 × 1/12345 = 1`

::: problem id=1_5 marks=1
__1.5__ What is the multiplicative inverse of zero?  

* [ ] `1/0`  
* [ ] Infinity  
* [ ] 1  
* [x] You can’t trick me, zero doesn’t have a multiplicative inverse  

---

A number multiplied by it's inverse always gives 1 and there is no way we can complete the calculation 0 × __?__ = 1.  

So poor zero is left without a multiplicative inverse and thus you cannot divide by zero.

__1.6__ Which number is it's OWN multiplicative inverse?

* [ ] -1
* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 10
* [ ] Infinity
{.col-5}

---

A number multiplied by it's inverse always gives 1, and there is no number we can use to complete the calculation 0 × __?__ = 1.  

So poor zero is left without a multiplicative inverse and thus you cannot divide by zero.

## 2. A puzzle

Unlike dividing by zero, which is definitely impossible - this puzzle is possible, just a bit of a challenge!  

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ What is the missing number?  

![](/resources/6-42-divide-by-zero/2-1-number-squares.jpg){image align="center"}

* [ ] 6
* [x] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 53
* [ ] 54
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
Look at the top right number. How can the other three numbers in the square be used to create that top right number? Is there a pattern?
  
eg 9 __?__ - 5 = 67  
  
How can you use the 8 to make this sum complete?  
^^^

---

The pattern is multiply the bottom two numbers and subtract the top left to get the top right:  

7 × __?__ - 4 = 52

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
