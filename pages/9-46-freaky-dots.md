*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What is a half of a third, plus a third of a quarter, plus a quarter of a fifth?

* [ ] `1/1440`
* [ ] `3/38`
* [ ] `1/30`
* [ ] `1/3`
* [x] `3/10`

---

A half of a third is `1/2 × 1/3 = 1/6`, a third of a quarter is `1/3 × 1/4 = 1/12`, and a quarter of a fifth is `1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20`.  

It follows that the required answer is  

`1/6 + 1/12 + 1/20 = (10 + 5 + 3)/60 = 18/60 = 3/10`.

__2.1.__  A tetrahedron is a solid figure which has four faces, all of which are triangles.  

What is the product of the number of edges and the number of vertices of the tetrahedron?

* [ ] 8
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 18
* [x] 24

---

We can think of a tetrahedron as a pyramid with a triangular base.  

The base has 3 vertices and there is 1 more vertex, called the apex, at the peak of the pyramid. So a tetrahedron has 4 vertices.  

The base has 3 edges, and there are 3 more edges joining the vertices of the base to the apex. Therefore a tetrahedron has 3 + 3 = 6 edges.  

Finally, we observe that 4 × 6 = 24.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ Three different positive integers have a mean of 7.  

What is the largest positive integer that could be one of them?

* [ ] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17
* [x] 18
* [ ] 19
{.col-5}

---

Because the three integers have mean 7, their sum is `3 × 7 = 21`. For the largest of the three positive integers to be as large as possible the other two need to be as small as possible. Since they are different positive integers, the smallest they can be is 1 and 2. The largest of the three integers is then `21 − (1 + 2) = 18`. So 18 is the largest any of them could be.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ Tadashi slightly moves the pattern on the transparency over the identical pattern on the paper and sees a new pattern of circles. If the transparency is moved left/right, which direction does the centre of the circles move?

* [ ] Diagonally
* [ ] Does not move
* [ ] Left/right
* [x] Up/down
* [ ] In a loop

__5.1__ A rectangle is placed obliquely on top of an identical rectangle, as shown.  

The area `X` of the overlapping region (shaded more darkly) is one eighth of the total shaded area.  

What fraction of the area of one rectangle is `X`?

* [ ] `1/3`
* [ ] `2/7`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [x] `2/9`
* [ ] `1/5`
{.col-5}

---

The rectangles are identical. Therefore they have the same area. Let this area be `Y`.  

It follows that the area of each rectangle that is not part of the overlap is `Y − X`. Hence the total shaded area, made up of the two areas of the rectangles which are not part of the overlap, together with the overlap, is  

`2(Y − X) + X = 2Y − X`.  

We are given that the area of the overlap is one eighth of the total shaded area. Therefore  

`X/(2Y − X) = 1/8`.  

This equation may be rearranged to give  

`8X = 2Y − X`,  

from which it follows that  

`9X = 2Y`,  

and therefore that  

`X/Y = 2/9`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
