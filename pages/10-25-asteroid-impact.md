## 1. Asteroid sizes

This short video shows the sizes of various asteroids that have been spotted in outer space. In fact, some of them have actually struck Earth, such as _2008 TC3_.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Asteroid _99942 Apophis_ is the same shape and density as _2004 FH_, but 10 times taller. How much bigger is its mass?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 100
* [x] 1,000
* [ ] 10,000
* [ ] 100,000
* [ ] 1,000,000

If we multiply the length by `x`, then we multiply the volume (and therefore the mass by `x^3`, which is `10^3`, which is 1,000.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ The formula for kinetic energy (the energy of a moving object) is `1/2 mv^2`, where  
`m` = mass and `v` = velocity. If _99942 Apophis_ is not only 10 times taller, but also moving 10 times faster than _2004 FH_, then how much bigger is its kinetic energy?

* [ ] 10
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 1,000
* [ ] 10,000
* [x] 100,000
* [ ] 1,000,000
{.col-3}

The mass is 1,000 (`10^3`) times more massive and then we have to take into account `v^2` (`10^2`), so the energy is `10^5` times greater, ie 100,000 times greater.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ If the following numbers are arranged in increasing order of size, which one is in the middle?

* [ ] 4.04
* [ ] 4.004
* [ ] 4.4
* [ ] 4.44
* [x] 4.044

In increasing order, the numbers are 4.004, 4.04, 4.044, 4.4, 4.44.

<!--- (2005) Q11 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__ If two of the sides of a right-angled triangle are 5 cm and 6 cm long, how many possibilities are there for the length of the third side?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

---

The side of length 5cm cannot be the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle as it is shorter than the side of length 6cm.  

If the 6cm side is the hypotenuse, then the third side of the triangle has length `sqrt(11)` cm.  

If the 6cm side is not the hypotenuse, then the hypotenuse has length `sqrt(61)` cm.  

These are the only two possibilities.

## 4.	The shortest known maths paper

A “paper” is a published piece of research, and mathematics papers usually run to a few pages, and sometimes to over 100 pages (e.g. the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem).  

This is the shortest-known paper published in a serious mathematics journal.

![](/resources/10-25-asteroid-impact/4-maths-paper.png){image align="center"}

The mathematician Euler had conjectured (suggested) that you need at least four 4th powers to sum to a 4th power, or at least five 5th powers to sum to a 5th power, and so on. However, this paper gives an example where only four 5th powers sum to a 5th power (but I have replaced one of the numbers with a question mark). So the conjecture is wrong.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
__4.1__ What is the missing number?  

Clue: the answer is a two-digit number.  

`x^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5`

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=1
The numbers involved are very big, so your calculator might struggle. The best approach is to use your calculator’s memory function.

## 5. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2005) Q21 --->

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
![](/resources/10-25-asteroid-impact/5-diagram.png){image align="right"}
__5.1__ Two circles with radii 1 cm and 4 cm touch at a single point.  

The point `P` is on the smaller circle, `Q` is on the larger circle, and `PQ` is a tangent to both circles.  

What is the length of `PQ`?

* [ ] `sqrt(17)` cm
* [ ] 3 cm
* [ ] `2 sqrt(3)` cm
* [ ] `3 sqrt(2)` cm
* [x] 4 cm

^^^ hint id=5_1 marks=1
This diagram takes you a long way towards the answer. I must admit that, at first, I did not notice that `PA` is parallel to `QB`, because both radii must be perpendicular to the tangent `PQ`. That means `PA = QC`.

The diagram shows points `A` and `B`, which are the centres of the two circles, and `C`, the point on `BQ` such that `AC` is parallel to `PQ`.  

As radii `PA` and `QB` are both perpendicular to tangent `PQ`, `APQC` is a rectangle. So `ACB` is a right angled triangle.  

The length of `AB = 1 + 4 = 5`; the length of `BC = 4 - 1 = 3`.  

So, by Pythagoras' Theorem, `AC = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = 4`, which, therefore, is also the length of `PQ`.

In the meantime, you can find out your score, the answers and go through the answer sheet as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button below.

When you see your % score, this will also be your reward score. As you collect more and more points, you will collect more and more badges. Find out more by visiting the Rewards Page after you hit the SUBMIT button.

It is really important that you go through the solution sheet. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important than what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something new.

Cheerio,
Simon.
