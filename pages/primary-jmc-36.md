Buying a bottle of juice, drinking the juice and returning the bottle, involves a net cost of $1.00.  

Therefore, after doing this seven times, you will have $3 left, ie just sufficient to buy an eighth bottle.  

After drinking the juice of returning this bottle, you will have $2.00 left, but this is not enough to buy a 9th bottle.

The solution to 3 across is an odd square.  The only two-digit odd squares are 25, 49, and 81.  

The solution to one down is a square, but no squares have a unit digit of 2 or 8. So 1 down is 64 and 3 across is 49.  

Hence `x` = 9.  

Checking the remaining of the cross number, we note that 1 across is a square which has a tens digit of 6 and therefore is 64.  Finally, we note that 2 down is now 49, which is indeed a square.
