![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/2-triangle.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="65"/>  

---

The three angles sum to 180° and the other two angles are 25° and 90° so:  

C = 180 – (90 + 25) = 65°
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 5:1 and there are 42 students altogether, how many boys are there?

* [ ] 7
* [ ] 24
* [ ] 30
* [x] 35
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---

The number of boys is given by:  

`42/6 × 5 = 35`.

Which of these is prime?

* [x] 89
* [ ] 90
* [ ] 91
* [ ] 92
* [ ] 93
{.col-5}

---

* 90 and 92 are even  
* 93 is a multiple of 3
* 91 is 7 × 13
* Therefore the prime is 89

What is this shape called?

* [ ] Pentagon
* [ ] Hexagon

## 6.

Which of these is largest?

* [x] `3^4`
* [ ] `2^5`
* [ ] `5^2`
* [ ] `4^3`

The values, respectively, are  

* `3^4 = 81`
* `2^5 = 32`
* `5^2 = 25`
* `4^3 = 64`
* `6^2 = 36`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What is the mean of the numbers 3, 4, 5, 8, 10?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

There are five numbers in the list so the mean is given by:  

`(3 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10)/5 = 6`
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability that you get three heads?

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [x] `1/8`
* [ ] `1/10`
{.col-5}

---

The probability is given by   

`1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
Alan, Brian and Clara went shopping.  

Brian spent 30% of what Clara spent. Alan spent 10% more than Clara.  

Together they spent £72.  

How much did Alan spend (in £)?

£ <input type="number" solution="33"/>  

---

Let £x be the amount Clara spent. Then Alan spent £1.1x and Brian spent £0.3x.  

The total spend is £72, therefore:  

`72 = x + 1.1x + 0.3x = 2.4x`  

So `x = 72/2.4 = 360/12 = 30` and thus Clara spent £30 and Alan spent £33.

## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
A square is inscribed in a circle which in turn is then inscribed in a larger square.  

If the area of the smaller square is 10, what is the area of the larger square?

<input type="number" solution="20"/>  

---

For any radius `r` for the small square, the area of the small square is `2r^2` and the area of the large square is `4r^2`.  

If you’re not sure why, see Q10 of the course materials.  

So the large square always has twice the area of the small square.  

The area of the large square is therefore 20.

Regular pentagon `PQRST` has centre `O`.  

Lines `PH`, `FI` and `GJ` go through `O`.  

The six angles at `O` are equal.  

What is the size of angle `TFO`?

* [ ] 84°
* [x] 114°
* [ ] 92°
* [ ] 106°
* [ ] 108°
{.col-5}

---

The interior angles of a regular pentagon are 108°.  

From the diagram we deduce angle `SGO` = 360° – (60° + 90° + 108°) = 102°  

Therefore angle `TGO` = 180° – 102° = 78° (we showed this in Q11 of the course materials).  

In the quadrilateral `OFTG`, we have angles 60°, 78°, 108° and angle `TFO`.  

Therefore angle `TFO` = 360° – (60° + 78° + 108°) = 114°.

## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
The positive integers from 1 to 9 are placed in the grid, one to a cell, so that the product of the three numbers in each row or column is shown.  

What value goes in the middle right cell?  

![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/12-grid.jpg){image align="center"}

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 6
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

---

The top row must have the integers {3, 5, 7} in some order since 105 = 3 × 5 × 7.  

The 7 must go in the middle of the top row as it divides into 42 but not 80 or 108.  

The other two values of the middle column must be 6 and 1 and since 6 does not divide 32, it goes in the middle.  

The middle row must therefore contain a 2 and 9, and since 9 does not divide 80 it must go to the middle right.  

The completed grid is as shown.

## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
When buying an ice cream, you are allowed to make three choices:  

* Whether you want the ice cream in a cup or a cone.  
* The flavour: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, honeycomb, pistachio.  
* Size: small, medium, large.  

However, large ice creams only come in a cone.  

How many possible ice creams are there?  

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [x] 25
* [ ] 30
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---

Without the restriction there would be 2 × 5 × 3 = 30 possible combinations.  

But we have to remove the combinations that have both ‘cup’ and ‘large’ in them. There are 5 such ice creams (one for each flavour).  

This leaves 25 possible ice cream combinations.

## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/14-cryptarithm.png){image align="right"}

In this cryptarithm, what is the value of A?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] Not enough information

---

Since the product results in a four-digit answer, A can not be more than 2. So A is 1 or 2.  

We can quickly verify that A = 1 fails by inspecting the Ones column: there is no value of D for which 4 × D ends in a 1.  

So A = 2.  

The full solution is ABCD = 2178.

## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
Referring to the rectangles below, the largest is red an the smallest is blue.  

Orange is the same size as yellow and not next to blue.  

Which is orange?

![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/15-squares.jpg){image align="center"}

* [ ] A
* [x] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

Orange and yellow are B and D, though not necessarily in that order.  

Blue is E and, as orange is not next to blue, it cannot be D.  

So orange is B.  
:::


## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
What is 50% of 18.3 plus 18.3% of 50?

* [ ] 9.15
* [x] 18.3
* [ ] 27.15
* [ ] 59.15
* [ ] 68.3
{.col-5}

---

It is a general rule that x% of y equals y% of x.  

This is because x% of `y = x/100 × y = (xy)/100` and y% of `x = y/100 × x = (yx)/100`.  

So 50% of 18.3 plus 18.3% of 50  
= 50% of 18.3 plus 50% of 18.3  
= 100% of 18.3 = 18.3.

## 17.

![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/17-paper.jpg){image align="right"}
Four rectangular paper strips, each measuring 10 cm by 1 cm, are laid flat on a table.  

Each strip is at right angles to two of the other strips as shown.  

What is the area of the table covered by the strips?  

* [ ] 30 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 32 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 34 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 36 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 38 cm<sup>2</sup>

---

The total area of the four strips is 40 cm<sup>2</sup>, but there are four squares, each of area 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, where two strips overlap.  

Hence the area covered is (40 - 4) cm<sup>2</sup>.

My rabbit Nibbles lives in a moveable pen and helps to keep the grass short.  

The pen is rectangular and measures 3m by 2m, as shown in the diagram, where the arrow indicates North.  

On successive days, the pen is moved 1m East, 2m South, 1m West, and 2m North.  

What is the total area, in square metres, of the region of grass which Nibbles can nibble?   

* [ ] 6
* [ ] 12
* [x] 15
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 24
{.col-5}

So the area is that of a rectangle measuring 5m × 3m.

## 19.

![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/19-grid.jpg){image align="right"}

Each of the numbers 1 to 9 is to be placed in a different cell of the grid shown so that the sum of the three numbers in each row is 15.  

Also, the sum of the two numbers in each shaded column is to be 15.  

How many choices are there for the number to be placed in the central cell indicated by *? 

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

---

The sum of the two numbers in each shaded column is 15. Therefore, one of these columns contains the number 7 and 8, while the other column holds the numbers 6 and 9.  

Note also that two of these numbers, one from each column, combine with the number in the central cell to sum to 15. This is possible only if the number in the central cell is 1 and the shaded numbers in the central row are 6 and 8, or if the number in the central cell is 2 and the shaded numbers in the central row are 6 and 7.  

The diagrams below show how the grid may be completed correctly, with either 1 or 2 in the central cell, though these are not the only ways of doing so.

## 20.
::: problem id=20_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-4-test-winter/20-shapes.jpg){image align="right"}
Which one of the following shapes could not appear as the overlapping region of two identical squares?  

* [x] Equilateral triangle  
* [ ] Square  
* [ ] Kite  
* [ ] Heptagon  
* [ ] Regular octagon  

---

If the overlapping region is a triangle, two of its sides must be adjacent sides of one of the squares.  

So one of its angles will be a right angle, and therefore an equilateral triangle could not appear in the overlapping region.  

The diagrams show how the other options could appear as the overlapping region.
