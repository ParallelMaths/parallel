# Year 8 Summer Term Synoptic Paper

The purpose of this assignment is for you to review the session materials for one of our previous Year 7 modules, which will help to prepare you for more advanced modules in the Autumn.  

There are 20 questions, some of which you will be able to solve right away and some of which you are likely to find tricky. Questions marked with a skull and crossbones icon are particularly fiendish (but not impossible!).  

At the bottom of these instructions you will find links to PDFs of the session materials for this module. You should take the time to read through these **thoroughly** and you will find that all of the problems are similar to ones in the materials.  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if youâ€™ve given the problem some real thought.  

**Do not rush this assignment!** Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck.  

**You have until the end of August 31st to submit this assignment. Only submit once you have had a proper go at the questions (and have read through the session materials).**  

**After you click Submit, you will not be able to un-submit.** Full written solutions will be displayed and you should scroll down to see the correct answers and read the solutions.

_Please ignore any references to tutorials or tests and just focus on the maths content of these PDFs. Note there is no PDF for Week 6._
