# Parallel Academy Year 8 Spring Term Week 3 Assignment

These problems relate to a recent theme you have been covering during webinars. They are arranged in order of increasing difficulty and the final problem is much more of a challenge than the rest.  

The problems are designed to help you reflect on material from previous webinar sessions (which you can access on your Academy page).  

The number of marks each question or part is worth is shown. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if you’ve given the problem some real thought.   

Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. Please remember that completing homework is certainly not a race!  

**For questions where you need to type in the answer, unless otherwise specified you may assume the answer is a whole number, and you should only enter the number itself.**  

You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck (particularly with the final problem).   

**Before you click Submit at the end of the assignment, check that all of your answers have been entered correctly.** 
  
**After you click Submit, make sure you scroll down to see the correct answers and read the full written solutions.**
