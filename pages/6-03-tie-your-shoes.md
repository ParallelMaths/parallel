<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.  


## 1. Why Waste Time When You Could Use Maths?

Watch this Numberphile video showing a super fast way to tie your shoes

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ What was the name of Matt's "base knot", which had a minimum of three crossings?

* [ ] Tree Foil Knot
* [ ] Shrub Wrapping Knot
* [x] Trefoil Knot
* [ ] Figure 8 Knot

---

The Trefoil Knot is the simplest non-trivial prime knot, it has been depicted in stone carvings and in art throughout human history.

__1.2__ Before the loops are passed over to the other hand they must be going:

* [ ] The same direction, both looping forward
* [ ] The same direction, both looping backward
* [x] Different directions, one looping forward, one looping backwards

:::problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ This Trefoil Knot has three "crossings"

What is the combined total of the crossings of these knots?

<input type="number" solution="18"/> crossings

## 2. Life is Easier with Maths

From tying your shoelaces, to cutting a cake, to finding the quickest route on Google Maps, Maths can be used to make life easier and more efficient.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ You are organising a charity BBQ.  

Veggie patties are sold in boxes of 9, but the buns are sold in packs of 12.  

What is the smallest amount of assembled burgers you can make so that there will be no patties or buns left over?

<input type="number" solution="36"/> veggie burgers
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ Maths can even be used to make Maths easier!  

One of these numbers can be divided by 4 to give a whole number. Without doing the division, can you tell which one?

* [ ] 2387360945
* [ ] 4444444442
* [x] 1616161616
* [ ] 8000000022

(Hint: you only need to look at the last two digits)

---

If the last two digits of a number are in the 4 times table then the whole number is divisible by 4, no matter how big it is!

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
