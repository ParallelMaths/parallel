# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 10_ Colour Code Challenge

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain.  

*	Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
*	But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	The Colour Code Challenge

Below you can see the numbers from 1 to 20 represented by coloured circles, but what is the relationship between each number and its colours. If you can work out the relationship, then you will notice that one of the numbers is linked to the wrong colours.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=6
__1.1.__ Which number is linked to the wrong numbers? Some hints below if you need them.

^^^ hint id=1
Look for patterns. Which colours are linked which numbers? If you are thinking – that was a useless hint, then you wouldn’t be far wrong.
^^^

^^^ hint id=2
What colour is 2, and which numbers share that colour?
^^^

^^^ hint id=3
Which numbers only have a single colour?
^^^

^^^ hint id=4
2 is yellow, 4 is doubly yellow, 8 is triply yellow. Can you figure out why?
^^^

^^^ hint id=5
2 is yellow, 3 green and 6 is yellow and green. Why?
^^^

<input solution="19"/>

The prime numbers - 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17 are single colours. All of the other numbers are coloured according to their factors - so 4 is made up of two yellows, because the 2 is coloured yellow; 18 is made up of two greens (3s) and one yellow (2).

The exception is number 19, which is made up of two yellows (2s) and one green (3). However, 2 × 2 × 3 ≠ 19, and as 19 is a prime number it should be a single colour.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Gill went for a five-hour walk. Her average speed was between 3 km/h and 4 km/h.
Which of the following could be the distance she walked?

* [ ] 12 km
* [ ] 14 km
* [x] 19 km
* [ ] 24 km
* [ ] 35 km
{.col-5}

---

Walking at 3 km/h for five hours, Gill would walk 5 × 3 km = 15km, and at 4 km/h she would walk 5 × 4 km = 20 km.

As her average speed is between 3 km/h and 4 km/h, she walks between 15 km and 20 km. Of the options given, only 19 km is in this range.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
![](/resources/8-11-colour-code-challenge/3-rihlelo-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1.__ The diagram shows a weaver’s design for a _rihlèlò_, a winnowing tray
from Mozambique.

How many lines of symmetry does the design have?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 4
* [ ] 8

The four lines of symmetry are shown in the diagram.

## 4. Belated April Fools’ Day Prank

April Fools’ Day was back at the start of the month, but it is never too late to feature this video with Professor Matthew Weathers, lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Biola University in California. If you study maths or computing at university, I cannot promise that all your lectures will be as fun as this one.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge bonus (2013)

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1.__ What is the value of `( (1 - 1) - 1) - (1 - (1 - 1))`?

* [x] -2
* [ ] +1
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
{.col-5}

---

We have `( (1 - 1) - 1) - (1 - (1 - 1)) = (0 - 1) - (1 - 0) = -2`

## 6. The North Pole riddle – the genius version

This video is titled “Elon Musk’s favorite interview question”, and it is explores in great depth a question that we have covered in two recent Parallelograms. By the way, if you have not heard of Elon Musk, he studied physics at university and he is now labelled the real life Iron Man because he has built a business empire based on developing incredible technology – everything from batteries to rockets. In fact, the second video shows Elon Musk in a cameo in the “Iron Man 2” movie.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1.__ You are standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk 1 km south, 1 km west and 1 km north, and you end up exactly where you started. According to  Musk’s full answer, which of the following is most accurate?

* [ ] You are near the North Pole.
* [ ] You are near the South Pole.
* [x] You can be near either North or South Poles.
* [ ] You are on the Equator.
* [ ] You are in the centre of the Earth.
:::

::: problem id=5_1 marks=3
__6.2.__ Following on from the previous question, which of the following is most accurate?

* [ ] There is no possible location.
* [ ] The is one possible location.
* [x] There are two possible locations.
* [ ] There are 72 possible locations.
* [ ] There is an infinite number of possible locations.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Additional Stuff

* [This article – The real-life Iron Man](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/09/elon-musk-the-real-life-iron-man){target="_blank"} – will tell you a bit more about Elon Musk.

* Today’s first question was based on something I saw on the [www.mathforlove.com](www.mathforlove.com){target="_blank"} website, which (as the name suggests) has lots of great stuff for people who love math…ematics. For example, [this is a whole worksheet about the billiard ball problem](https://mathforlove.com/lesson/billiard-ball-problem/){target="_blank"}. It is quite a project and it is written as if the reader is a teacher preparing something for students, but it will also make sense if you are a student.

* Teachers and parents (and maybe students) might also be interested in this short TEDx talk by Dan Finkel who started the website, in which he explains the best ways to develop a love of maths and some concrete skills – “Five Principles of Extraordinary Math Teaching”
