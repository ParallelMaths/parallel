# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 11_ Colour Code Challenge

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain.  

*	Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
*	But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.	The Colour Code Challenge

Below you can see the numbers from 1 to 20 represented by coloured circles, but what is the relationship between each number and its colours? If you can work out the relationship, then you will notice that one of the numbers is linked to the wrong colours.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=6
__1.1.__ Which number is linked to the wrong colours? There are some hints below if you need them.

^^^ hint id=1
Look for patterns. Which colours are linked to which numbers?
^^^

^^^ hint id=2
What colour is 2, and which numbers share that colour?
^^^

^^^ hint id=3
Which numbers only have a single colour?
^^^

^^^ hint id=4
2 is yellow, 4 is doubly yellow, 8 is triply yellow. Can you figure out why?
^^^

^^^ hint id=5
2 is yellow, 3 is green and 6 is yellow and green. Why?
^^^

<input solution="19"/>

The prime numbers - 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17 are single colours. All of the other numbers are coloured according to their prime factors - so 4 is made up of two yellows, because the 2 is coloured yellow, and 4 = 2 × 2; 18 is made up of two greens (3s) and one yellow (2), because 18 = 3 × 3 × 2.

The exception is number 19, which is made up of two yellows (2s) and one green (3). However, 2 × 2 × 3 ≠ 19, and as 19 is a prime number it should be a single colour.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge (2013)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Gill went for a five-hour walk. Her average speed was between 3 km/h and 4 km/h.
Which of the following could be the distance she walked?

* [ ] 12 km
* [ ] 14 km
* [x] 19 km
* [ ] 24 km
* [ ] 35 km
{.col-5}

---

Walking at 3 km/h for five hours, Gill would walk 5 × 3 km = 15 km, and at 4 km/h she would walk 5 × 4 km = 20 km.

As her average speed is between 3 km/h and 4 km/h, she walks between 15 km and 20 km. Of the options given, only 19 km is in this range.

__3.1.__ The diagram shows a weaver’s design for a _rihlèlò_, a winnowing tray
from Mozambique.

How many lines of symmetry does the design have?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 4
* [ ] 8

## 4. Belated April Fools’ Day Prank

April Fools’ Day was back at the start of the month, but it is never too late to feature this video with Professor Matthew Weathers, lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Biola University in California. If you study maths or computing at university, I cannot promise that all your lectures will be as fun as this one.

## 5. Felix Klein’s birthday

This week, back in 1849, it was the birthday of Felix Klein, the great German mathematician. You can find out more about Felix Klein in the “Additional Stuff” section.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1.__ He was born on 25 April 1849, or 25/4/1849. Why is this this a remarkable birthday for a mathematician?

* [ ] Each number shares a particular property linked to addition.
* [ ] Each number shares a particular property linked to subtraction.
* [x] Each number shares a particular property linked to multiplication.
* [ ] Each number shares a particular property linked to factorials.
* [ ] Each number shares a particular property linked to fractions.

---

Each of the date of birth numbers is linked to multiplication because 25/4/1849 could be written as 5<sup>2</sup>/2<sup>2</sup>/43<sup>2</sup> (and squaring is an operation based on multiplication).

## 6. The Möbius loop

Felix Klein is best known for the Klein bottle, a weird bottle (below left) that has no inside and no outside. If you are a fan of the sci-fi comedy “Futurama”, then you might remember a shelf of Klein bottles appearing in the episode “The Route of All Evil” (below right).

![](/resources/8-11-colour-code-challenge/6-klein-bottles.jpg){image align="center"}

Although in many senses it is impossible to create a Klein bottle in our normal 3-D world, it can in theory be constructed by joining two Möbius loops. You might now be wondering, “what is a Möbius loop?”. In short, it is an object that only has one side. Every piece of paper, of course, has two sides – a top and a bottom, or maybe a back and a front. However, you can turn a piece or strip of paper into an object that has only one side! (By the way, a Möbius loop is sometimes called a Möbius strip or a Möbius band.)

Making a Möbius loop involves taking a strip of paper, forming a loop, then making half a twist in one end, and finally joining the two ends with sticky tape.

The video below shows how you can make a Möbius loop for yourself. Once you have created a couple of Möbius loops, have a go at answering the questions below.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=3
__6.1.__ What happens when you cut a Möbius loop in half lengthways?

* [ ] You create zero loops.
* [ ] You create a half a loop.
* [x] You create one loop.
* [ ] You create two loops.
* [ ] You create a mess.
:::

::: problem id=6_2 marks=4
__6.2.__ What happens when you cut the Möbius loop along its length, but starting one third of the way from the edge (NOT in the middle)? Keep cutting until you get back to where you started and the cut is complete. What have you created?

* [ ] No loops, just one long strip.
* [ ] One big loop.
* [ ] Two loops of equal size.
* [x] One small loop and one big loop.
* [ ] Three loops.

Hopefully you will have got the right answers and been shocked by them. Right or wrong, take a look at this video that examines what happens if you cut a Möbius loop a third of they way from the edge. It also looks a couple of other cutting mysteries, all in just a couple of minutes.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,
