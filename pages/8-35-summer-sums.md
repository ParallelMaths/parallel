# Summer Sums

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s summer and the school year is over (or maybe it’s nearly over), but that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of mathematics. If you are taking mathematics seriously and if you are having fun with it (being serious and having fun can go together), then it is important that you keep the numbers and geometry parts of your brain at least a little bit busy over the summer. I am hoping that your teacher will have set you some holiday work, but on top of that here is a longer than usual Parallelogram.  

Most of the questions are from past Junior Maths Challenge papers that you have seen before, but I have also added a sprinkling of other things to make the Parallelogram (even) more interesting.  

It will take you an hour or two to complete this Parallelogram, so maybe tackle it across three or four sessions... but don’t forget to complete it before term starts.  

And... if you have missed any earlier Parallelograms then the summer is a great time to do some catching up.

For it to be possible to draw a figure without taking the pen off the paper and without drawing along an existing line, there must be at most two points in the figure at which an odd number of lines meet.

Only E satisfies this condition.

* [x] 64
* [ ] 100
* [ ] 144

The unmarked interior angle on the right of the triangle `= (360 - 324)° = 36°`. So, by the exterior angle theorem, `x = 100 - 36 = 64`.

## 5. Airplanes taking off

::: problem id=5_1 marks=3
__5.1__ When a plane is taking off, which of the following would the pilot prefer?

* [x] Wind blowing in the opposite direction to plane moving along the runway.
* [ ] Wind blowing the same direction to the plane moving along the runway.
* [ ] Wind blowing from the side.
* [ ] Wind blowing from the other side.
* [ ] No wind.

---

The wings generate more lift if the air passing over them is moving faster. So the plane needs to reach a take-off speed relative to the air. If the wind is blowing in the opposite direction to the plane’s motion, then it is easier to reach the take-off speed.

The cost of 1 kg of potatoes is £1.25 ÷ 2.5 = 50p. So the cost of 1 tonne, that is 1000 kg, is 1000 × 50p = £500.

What is the correct answer?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9

As 2, 5 and 10 are all factors of the correct product, this product is a multiple of 100. So the last digit and the last-but-one digit are both zero.

If the mean of `y` and `z` is `x`, then `y + z = 2x`. So the sum of the interior
angles of the triangle is `(x + y + z) ° = 3x°`. So `3x = 180`, that is `x = 60`.

__11.1.__ Which of the following is the longest period of time?

* [x] `3002` hours
* [ ] `125` days
* [ ] `17 1/2` weeks
* [ ] `4` months
* [ ] `1/3` of a year

---

One year is, at most, 366 days, so one-third of a year is less than 125 days.

No month is longer than 31 days, so 4 months is also less than 125 days, as is 17.5 weeks which equals 122.5 days.

However 3002 hours equals 125 days 2 hours, so this is the longest of the five periods of time.

__12.1.__ Sir Lance has a lot of tables and chairs in his house. Each rectangular table seats eight people and each round table seats five people.

What is the smallest number of tables he will need to use to seat 35 guests and himself, without any of the seating around these tables remaining unoccupied?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

There are 36 people to be seated so at least five tables will be required. The number of circular tables must be even.

However, five rectangular tables will seat 40 people and three rectangular and two circular will seat 34. So at least six tables are needed.

Two rectangular and four circular tables do seat 36 people: so six is the minimum number of tables.

As 108 marks represented 18% of the final total, 6 marks represented 1% of the final total. So this total was 600.

__14.1__ The letters `J`, `M`, `C` represent three different non-zero digits, where JM + JM + CC = JMC.

What is the value of `J + M + C`?

* [ ] 19
* [x] 18
* [ ] 17
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 15

---
The hundreds column shows us that `J = 1` or `2`. [We can’t carry more than 2
from the units to the tens; and 2 plus the biggest feasible values 7, 8, 9 for the
three letters is only 26.]

The units column shows that `J + M` is a multiple
of 10 and it can’t be 0 (or else `J + M = 0`); so `J + M = 10` and `M = 9` or `8` respectively.

Also, the sum of the units column is `10 + C`, so there is exactly `1` to carry to the tens column. The tens column now tells us that `J + C + 1 = 10J`. So `J = 2` is not possible and therefore `J = 1`, `C = 8` and `M = 9`.

You need the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 1,2,3,4,5 and 6. Since every number is a multiple of 1, and every multiple of 4 is a multiple of 2, and every multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, you really only need to consider the LCM of 4,5 and 6.
^^^

---

The lowest common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is required. Of these numbers, 2, 3 and 5 are prime whilst 4 = 2² and 6 = 2 × 3.

So their lowest common multiple is 2² × 3 × 5, that is 60.

The other times that this has happened previously are when Sam's age in years went from 1 to 2; from 4 to 5; from 16 to 17 and from 36 to 37.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 20

Since `PT = QT`, `PTQ` is an isosceles triangle, so `∠QPT = 20°`.

^^^ hint id=18_2
Since `QS = SR`, `QSR` is an isosceles triangle as well, so `∠QRS = x°`. Now consider the angles which form triangle `PQR`.
^^^

![](/resources/8-35-summer-sums/18-diagram-answer.gif){image align="right"}
As `QS = SR`. `∠SRQ = ∠SQR = x°`.

So `∠QST = 2x°` (exterior angle theorem). Also `∠TQS = 2x°` since `QT = TS`.

As `PT = QT`, `∠TPQ = ∠TQP = 20°`.

Consider the interior angles of triangle `PQR`: `20 + (20 + 2x + x) + x = 180`.

So `4x + 40 = 180`, hence `x = 35`.

What is the smallest number of the five villages that Pat will have to visit more than once?

* [ ] 1

Villages which have more than two roads leading to them (or from them) must all be visited more than once as a single visit will involve at most two roads. So Bentonville, Pencaster and Wytham must all be visited more than once.

The route Home, Bentonville, Greendale, Wytham, Bentonville, Pencaster, Home, Wytham, Horndale, Pencaster, Home starts and finishes at Home and visits both Greendale and Horndale exactly once so the minimum number of villages is three.

## 20. Can You Solve This Chess Conundrum?

This puzzle was featured on the BBC TV show “QI”. First, you need to know that the knight in chess moves in an L-shape, as shown in the image below. “L” means 2 squares left/right and 1 up/down, or 2 up/down and 1 left/right.

__21.1__ The diagram on the right shows a rhombus `FGHI` and an isosceles triangle `FGJ` in which `GF = GJ`. Angle `FHI = 111°`.

What is the size of angle `JFI`?

* [x] 27°
* [ ] 29°
* [ ] 31°
* [ ] 33°
* [ ] 34.5°

^^^ hint id=21_1 marks=1
Since ∠IJF and ∠FJG form a straight line, they sum to 180, so ∠FJG = 180 – 111 = 69. Since FGJ is an isosceles triangle, ∠GFJ also equals 69.
^^^

^^^ hint id=21_2 marks=1
The remaining angle in triangle FGJ is 180 – 2 × 69 = 42. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with four equal sides, so when split along the diagonal makes two isosceles triangles.
^^^

^^^ hint id=21_3 marks=1
In isosceles triangle FGI, ∠FGI = ∠GIF = 42. You now have two angles of the triangle FJI.
^^^

---

![](/resources/8-35-summer-sums/21-angles-answer.gif){image align="right"}
Adjacent angles on a straight line add up to 180°, so `∠GJF = 180° - 111° = 69°`.

In triangle `FGJ`, `GJ = GF` so `∠GFJ = ∠GJF`. Therefore `∠FGJ = (180 − 2 × 69)° = 42°`.

As the shape `FGHI` is a rhombus, `FG = FI` and therefore `∠GIF = ∠FGJ = 42°`.

Finally, from triangle `FJI`, `∠JFI = (180 - 111 - 42)° = 27°`.

You do not have any two entries given which lie in the same three-box stack, so instead of working out a particular value, label the box next to 12 as `a`. Now label the box next to 78 with an expression, using the fact that this box plus `a = 90`.

Let the numbers in the boxes be as shown in the diagram.

Then `b = 90 - a`; `c = 12 + a`; `d = b + 78 = 168 - a`.

Also, `e = 90 + c = 102 + a`; `f = 90 + d = 258 − a`.

So `x = e + f = 102 + a + 258 - a = 360`.

The primes less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7,  11, 13, 17, 19. The number 2 is the only even prime, so you cannot use it, because otherwise one sum will be (even + odd) and the two others will be (odd + odd) (
^^^

---

The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. It is not possible for 2 to be one of the six numbers Kiran wrote down, since that would give one of the pairs an odd sum, whereas both of the other pairs would add up to an even number.

The sum of the remaining 7 primes is 75 which is a multiple of 3. The sum of the six primes making up the three pairs must also be a multiple of 3 since each pair has the same total.

So the odd prime not used in the six pairs must be a multiple of 3 too. Therefore 3 is the
odd prime not used. So each pair totals 72 ÷ 3, that is 24, and the pairs are 5 + 19 7 + 17 11 + 13.
