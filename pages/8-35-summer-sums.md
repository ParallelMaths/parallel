# Summer Sums

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s summer and the school year is over (or maybe it’s nearly over), but that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of mathematics. If you are taking mathematics seriously and if you are having fun with it (being serious and having fun can go together), then it is important that you keep the numbers and geometry parts of your brain at least a little bit busy over the summer. I am hoping that your teacher will have set you some holiday work, but on top of that here is a longer than usual Parallelogram.  

Most of the questions are from past Junior Maths Challenge papers that you have seen before, but I have also added a sprinkling of other things to make the Parallelogram (even) more interesting.  

It will take you an hour or two to complete this Parallelogram, so maybe tackle it across three or four sessions... but don’t forget to complete it before term starts.  

And... if you have missed any earlier Parallelograms then the summer is a great time to do some catching up.

__1.1__ Which of the following has the largest value?

* [ ] `1/2` + `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2` - `1/4`

The values of the five expressions are:

* `1/2` + `1/4` = `3/4`
* `1/2` - `1/4` = `1/4`
* `1/2` × `1/4` = `1/8`
* `1/2` ÷ `1/4` = `2`
* `1/4` ÷ `1/2` = `1/2`

So `1/2` ÷ `1/4` has the largest value.

Let the other angles be as marked in the diagram. Then `y = 65` as the angles marked 65°
and `y`° are the base angles of an isosceles triangle.

Because the angles in a triangle sum to `180°, z = 180 - 65 - 65 = 50`.

Now, `w = z`, as the angles marked `w`° and `z`° are vertically opposite. Therefore `w = 50`. So, the angle marked `x`° is the third angle of a triangle in which the other two angles are 50° and 90°.

Therefore `x = 180 - 50 - 90 = 40`.

Walking at 3km/h for five hours, Gill would walk 5 × 3 km = 15 km, and at 4km/h she would walk 5× 4 km = 20 km.

As her average speed is between 3 km/h and 4 km/h, she walks between 15 km and 20km. Of the options given, only 19 km is in this range.

__5.1__ When a plane is taking off, which of the following would the pilot prefer?

* [ ] Wind blowing the same direction to the plane moving along the runway.
* [ ] Wind blowing from the side.
* [ ] Wind blowing from the other side.

---

The wings generate more lift if the air passing over them is moving faster. So the plane needs to reach a take-off speed relative to the air. If the wind is blowing in the opposite direction to the plane’s motion, then it is easier to reach the take-off speed.

Suppose that the square has side length 3d. Then the square has perimeter of length 4 × 3d = 12d.

Each rectangle has size 3d × d. So we see that the octagon has a perimeter length:

4d + 3d + 4d + d + 3d + d + 3d + d = 20d

Hence the ratio of the lengths is 12d:20d = 3:5

The total number of pips on the top and bottom faces of the two dice is 7 + 7 = 14. As there is a total number of 5 pips on the touching faces, there are 14 - 5 = 9 pips altogether on the top and bottom faces of the stack.

__13.1__ Beth, Carolyn and George love reading their favourite bedtime stories together. They take it in turns to read a page, always in the order Beth, then Carolyn, then George. All twenty pages of the story are read on each occasion. One evening, Beth is staying at Grandma's house but Carolyn and George still read the same bedtime story and take it in turns to read a page with Carolyn reading the first page.

In total, how many pages that Carolyn and George read are the same as the pages that they would read if Beth was there?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 4
* [x] 6
* [ ] 7
{.col-5}

---

One way to do this is to write down a list of 20 pages and then label how they would be read usually and then on the night that Beth is away.

| Usual	| B	| C	| G	| B	| C	| G	| B	| C	| G	| B	|
| Page	| 1	| 2	| 3	| 4	| 5	| 6	| 7	| 8	| 9	| 10 |
| ~~Beth~~ | C | G | C | G | C | G | C | G | C | G |
{.grid}

| Usual	| C	| G	| B	| C	| G	| B	| C	| G	| B	| C |
| Page	| 11	| 12	| 13	| 14	| 15	| 16	| 17	| 18	| 19	| 20 |
| ~~Beth~~ | C	| G	| C	| G	| C	| G	| C	| G	| C	| G |
{.grid}

By comparison, you can see that pages 5, 6, 11, 12, 17 & 18 are read by the same person, regardless of Beth’s absence. Next is a more mathematical approach to the problem.

When all three children are present, Carolyn reads pages 2, 5, 8, ... , that is those pages whose number leaves remainder 2 when divided by 3. George reads pages 3, 6, 9, ... that is, those whose number is a multiple of 3. When Beth stays at Grandma's, Carolyn reads pages 1, 3, 5, ... that is the odd numbered pages, and George reads the even numbered pages. So the pages that Carolyn reads both normally and also when Beth is away are those with numbers which have remainder 2 when divided by 3, and are odd. That is, the three pages 5, 11 and 17.

The pages that George reads both normally and also when Beth is away are those with numbers that are multiples of 3 and are even, that is, the three pages 6, 12 and 18. So there are altogether 6 pages which are read by the same person normally and when Beth is away, namely pages 5, 6, 11, 12, 17 and 18.

However, Peri stops for a 24-hour rest every tenth day, that is, after nine days
travelling. On which day does Peri arrive at Granny’s?

Until Peri reaches Granny’s, he travels 9m in 9 days and then rests for a day. So he travels 9m in 10 days. So it takes him 90 days to travel the first 9m x 9 = 81m.

Then after a further 9 days he has travelled the final 9m and has reached Granny’s. So the journey takes him 99 days. Now 99 = 14 x 7 + 1, so the journey takes him 14 weeks and 1 day. Therefore he arrives on a
Tuesday.

__16.1__ The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are to be placed, one per square, in the diagram shown such that the four numbers in the horizontal row add up
to 21 and the four numbers in the vertical column add up to 21.

Which number should replace `x`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [x] 7
* [ ] 8

---

If we add all the numbers in the horizontal column and all the numbers in the vertical row, we get a total of 21 + 21 = 42 . In doing this sum we add in all the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 once except for `x` which is added in twice. So the total we get is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + `x` = 35 + `x`. Since this equals 42, we must have `x` = 7.

To complete the solution we should check that with `x` = 7, it is possible to place the remaining numbers in the other squares so that the four numbers in the horizontal row add up to 21, and so also do the four numbers in the vertical column.

__17.1__ Weighing the baby at the clinic was a problem. The baby would not keep still and caused the scales to wobble. So I held the baby and stood on the scales while the nurse read off 78 kg.

We let the weights of the baby, the nurse and myself be `x` kg, `y` kg and `z` kg, respectively. The information we are given implies that `x + z = 78`, `x + y = 69` and `y + z = 137`.

Adding these three equations gives `(x + z) + (x + y) + (y + z) = 78 + 69 + 137`, that is, `2x + 2y + 2z = 284`.

It follows `x + y + z = 142`. So the combined weight of all three was 142 kg.

Therefore, from the right angled triangle `PQS` we deduce that `x + 1/5 x + 90 = 180` and so `6/5 x = 90`. Therefore `x = 5/6 × 90 = 75`.

So `∠QSR` is 75°.

The solid is made up of 7 cubes. So each of them has volume `875/7` = 125 = 5<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>3</sup>. Hence the side length of each of the cubes is 5cm.

If a row, column or diagonal already sums to 34, then you probably don’t need to adjust anything, so cross out all the numbers in those columns, rows and diagonal. The numbers that you need to swap will be among whatever numbers are left.

One of the remaining numbers is the 13 on the diagonal that goes from top left to bottom right, which totals to only 32. So this will need to be swapped with the 15 on the bottom row. As well as correcting the faulty diagonal, this swap also fixes the other problematic rows and columns.

So, the two swapped numbers are 13 + 15 = 28, which means the answer is 28.

And that’s it for this academic year. I hope you’ve enjoyed doing Parallel this year and make sure you come back in September, when we will have our brand new Year 9 Parallelograms.  

But, before that, a few important points.  

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
