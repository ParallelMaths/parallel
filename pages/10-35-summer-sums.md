# Summer Sums

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

It’s summer and the school year is over (or maybe it’s nearly over), but that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of mathematics. If you are taking mathematics seriously and if you are having fun with it (being serious and having fun can go together), then it is important that you keep the numbers and geometry parts of your brain at least a little bit busy over the summer. I am hoping that your teacher will have set you some holiday work, but on top of that here is a longer than usual Parallelogram.  

Most of the questions are from past Intermediate Maths Challenge papers, but I have also added a sprinkling of other things to make the Parallelogram (even) more interesting.   

It will take you an hour or two to complete this Parallelogram, so maybe tackle it across three or four sessions … but don’t forget to complete it before the new term starts.  

And... if you have missed any earlier Parallelograms then the summer is a great time to do some catching up.  


## 1. QI mathematics

Here is a neat video from the BBC show “QI”, which demonstrates a lovely maths trick.  

(This trick was mentioned in a Year 9 Parallelogram, but the video clip is a lovely and funny demonstration of the trick, so it is worth watching and following the explanation again.)

@[youtube](FN8cwiDKrkI?rel=0) _(If you have problems watching the video, right click to open it in a new window)_

To summarise...  

* write down a three-digit number whose digits are decreasing and different.  
* reverse the digits to create a new number.  
* subtract this new number from the original number to get a SUB-RESULT.  
* Add the SUB-RESULT to the reverse of itself.  
* The final RESULT will always be 1089.  

I like how QI turned it into a magic trick, predicting the 10th word on page 89 of a book. You might like to try this trick.  

The big mystery is this – why does it work?  

If the person picks the number ABC, then the reverse would be CBA, and result of the subtraction would be (100A + 10B + C) - (100C + 10B + A) to get 99(A - C).   

Because the digits were decreasing, (A - C) is between 2 and 9, so the result must be 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, or 891.  

When you add any one of these numbers to the reverse of itself, the result is always 1089.

30 ÷ 0.2 = 300 ÷ 2 = 150, or 30 ÷ 0.2 = 30 ÷ 1/5 = 30 × 5 = 150.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ In Britain in 1996 we consumed on average 9.6kg of bananas per person per year (that is, around 60 bananas each). In some parts of Africa, the consumption of bananas is as high as 250kg of bananas per person per year. Roughly how many bananas is that?

* [x] 4 or 5 a day
* [ ] 1 or 2 a day
* [ ] 4 or 5 a week
* [ ] 1 or 2 a week
* [ ] 4 or 5 a month
{.col-3}

---

250 kg is approximately 25 times 9.6 kg. The consumption in some parts of Africa is therefore approximately 25 × 60, ie 1500, per person per year. 4 bananas per day are equivalent to 4 × 365, ie 1460, per year and the best answer is therefore 4 or 5 a day.

* [ ] 54°
* [ ] 72°
* [ ] 90°
* [x] 108°
* [ ] 144°

---

Triangle `PQR` is isosceles and therefore `PQR` = `PRQ` = 72°.

Triangle `PSR` is also isosceles therefore `RPS` = `RSP` = 36° (using the external angle theorem or by calculating that `PRS` = 108°) and `x` = 180° - 36° - 36° = 108°.

__6.1__ It is evening, and Meg, who is 1m tall, casts a shadow of length 3m. If Meg stands on her brother's shoulders, which are 1.5m above the ground, how long a shadow will she and her brother cast?

* [ ] 3m
* [ ] 4.5m
* [ ] 5.5m

The ratio of height to shadow length is 1:3. Their shadow will therefore be 3 × (1 + 1.5) m = 7.5m long.

__7.1__ In March 1998, a book called "The Shadow of the East" was returned to a library in Sussex. It had been borrowed on January 3rd 1924! The library charges a fine of 60p per week for overdue books. Approximately how big a fine should the person who returned the book have paid?

* [ ] £45

The fine should be approximately 74 × 52 × 60p ≈ 75 × £30 = £2250. Although in reality, the person who returned the book disappeared without paying a fine at all!

__9.1__ A pencil AB lying on a table is given a half-turn about the end B (so that A moves to A') and then a half-turn about A' (so that B moves to B').  

The point C on the pencil is one third of the way from A to B.

Let AB be of length 3r. The distanced moved by A is then the circumference of a semicircle of radius 3r, ie 3πr. C moves along the circumference of a semicircle of radius 2r, ie 2πr, followed by the circumference of a semicircle of radius r, ie πr. The total distance moved by C is therefore also 3πr.

The area of the largest circle = 25π cm<sup>2</sup>.

Let the number of boys in Group I be `x`. The number of girls in Group I is therefore 40 - `x` and the number of girls in Group II is 33 - (40 - `x`) = `x` - 7.  

Therefore there are 7 girls fewer in Group II than there are boys in Group I.

Two murders: `2x` hours;  
Six car thefts: `6(x/6)` = `x` hours;  
Four bank robberies: `4(x/2)` = `2x` hours.  

Total = `(2x + x + 2x)` hours = `5x` hours.

The fold is made along `BE`. `A` folds onto `A'`.  

`A'B = AB = sqrt(2)`, therefore `A'C = 1` (by Pythagorus).  

Triangle `A'BC` is therefore a right-angled isosceles triangle, therefore `BA'C = 45°`, therefore `EA'D = 45°`.  

Thus `ED = A'D = sqrt(2) - 1`.

Take the units digits of any two numbers and multiply them together. The units digit of the answer is also the units digit of the product of the original numbers. As 7 × 9 = 63, the units digit of 567 × 3489 must also be 3.

__19.__ An ice cream stall sells vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice creams.

The pie chart illustrates the sales of ice cream for last Saturday.  

The number of vanilla and the number of chocolate ice creams sold were the same.  

The stall sold 60 strawberry ice creams.  

How many chocolate ice creams were sold?

The angle occupied by the 'chocolate' sector is `1/2(360° - 90°) = 135°`. This is `1 1/2` times bigger than the 'strawberry' sector and hence the number of chocolate ice creams sold is `1 1/2 × 60 = 90`.

The numbers along the leading diagonal total 58 and this is therefore the sum of each row and column. We can now calculate that the number to the left of the 10 must be 20, and the number below that is 7. Hence `x = 58 - (16 + 14 + 7) = 21`.

And that’s it for this academic year. I hope you’ve enjoyed doing Parallel this year and make sure you come back in September, when we will have our brand new Year 11 Parallelograms.  

But, before that, a few important points.  

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
* This was our last Parallelogram of the year, but be sure to come back in September for more puzzles and problems.

Cheerio,
Simon.
