## 1. Juice and water

At break, every student in the class chooses to drink either water or juice.

Use this information to work out the values of A, B, C, and D in the table.

* There are 20 students at break
* There are 13 girls at break
* 8 students are drinking Juice
* 2 boys are drinking water

It probably helps to extend the table, so that we have space to talk about the total numbers of boys, girls, juices and waters.  

And we know that the total number of drinks and the total number of students both add up to 20.

So, we know from the question that:

* total girls = 13, so total boys = 7
* total juice = 8, so total water = 12
* 2 boys drink water = 2, so D = 2.

If total water is 12, and 2 boys drink water, then 10 girls drink water, so B = 10.

It is now obvious that A = 3 and C = 5.

## 2. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (1999) Q03 --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ A certain company offers "750 hours of free Internet use for new subscribers". On closer inspection it becomes clear that this time must be used during the new subscriber's first month of membership!

What is the maximum number of hours in any one month of the year?

* [ ] 168
* [ ] 692
* [ ] 720
* [x] 744
* [ ] 750
{.col-5}

---

The maximum number of days in any month is 31, and 31 × 24 = 744.

## 3.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (1999) Q13 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
![](/resources/10-33-juice-water/3-semicircle.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1__ The diagram shows a semicircle containing a circle which touches the circumference of the semicircle and goes through the midpoint of its diameter.  

What fraction of the semicircle is shaded?

* [ ] `2/3`
* [x] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/π`
* [ ] `2/π`
* [ ] `3/π`
{.col-5}

---

Let the radius of the circle be `r`. This implies that the radius of the semicircle is `2r`. The area of the semicircle is therefore `1/2 × π × (2r)^2 = 2πr^2` which is twice the area of the circle.

## 4.	Squares on a chess board 	

::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1__ Of course, we know there are 64 small squares on an 8x8 chess board, but how many squares are there in total if we count squares of all sizes?

![](/resources/10-33-juice-water/4-chessboard.png){image align="center"}  

For example, the board above shows a 1x1 square (top left), a 2x2 square (bottom left) and a 4x4 square, but how many squares are there in total?

<input solution="204"/>

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=1
How many squares of size 1x1 can you find? How many squares of size 2x2 can you find? And so on. Is there a pattern?
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_2 marks=1
There are 64 squares of size 1x1. There are 49 squares of size 2x2. And so on.
^^^

You need to break down the problem by looking at different sizes of squares and counting the number of each size of square.  

There are 64 squares of size 1x1. There are 49 squares of size 2x2. And so on.  

So you need to add up all the square numbers from 1 to 64. And the answer is 204.

## 5. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (1999) Q23 --->

::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
![](/resources/10-33-juice-water/5-star.jpg){image align="right"}
__5.1__ In the star shown here the sum of the four numbers in any "line" is the same for each of the five "lines".  

The five missing numbers are 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  

Which number is represented by K?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 11
* [ ] 12
* [x] 13
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5_1 marks=1
The ten numbers in the star total 75. Each number appears in two "lines" and therefore the five "lines" total 150, which implies the sum of the numbers in each "line" is 30.  
^^^

---

The ten numbers in the star total 75. Each number appears in two "lines" and therefore the five "lines" total 150, which implies the sum of the numbers in each "line" is 30.  

This means that K + C = 24 and therefore K = 11 and C = 13, or vice versa.  

If K = 11, then U = 12; I = 10 and M = 11, which is impossible since K = 11.  

If K = 13, then U = 10; I = 12; M = 9 and C = 11, which is correct.
