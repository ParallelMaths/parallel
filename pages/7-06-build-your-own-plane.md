# Build your own plane

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by Sunday 27 Oct if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

As most of you will have a half-term coming up, this Parallelogram is longer than usual and has a couple of extra questions. And your next parallelogram will be in __two weeks time on 31st October__, and it will be appropriately terrifying.


## 1. Palindromic products

This is a cute pattern.

1 × 1 = 1  
11 × 11 = 121  
111 × 111 = 12321  
1111 × 1111 = 1234321  
11111 × 11111 = 123454321  
111111 × 111111 = 12345654321  
1111111 × 1111111 = 1234567654321  
11111111 × 11111111 = 123456787654321  
111111111 × 111111111 = 12345678987654321
{.text-center}

The product, the result of multiplying numbers with repeating 1s, has this beautiful symmetry. The products are palindromes, which means that they are the same whether written forwards or backwards.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1.__ What happens if we add one more 1?  

What is 1111111111 × 1111111111?  

Of course, you can type this into a calculator, but first try to follow the pattern and work out what the answer might be… then check it with a calculator.

<input type="number" solution="1234567900987654321"/>  

---

If you follow the pattern, the result should be:

123456789<sub>10</sub>987654321.
{.text-center}

The 10 fits in the middle, but we can’t write 10 where there is only space for 1 digit. Instead, we could put a 0 where the 10 is, and carry the 1 over to the column on the left, which gives us:

12345678<sub>9+1</sub>0987654321.
{.text-center}

But we can’t write (9 + 1), which is 10, where there is only space for 1 digit. Instead, we could put a 0 in that column and carry the 1 over to the column on the left, which gives us:

1234567900987654321.{.text-center}

## 2.	Building brilliant paper planes

Here is an interview with John Collins, who broke the world distance record for paper planes. Although John designs and builds the planes, he does not throw them.

Listen carefully, as I will be asking a question about the thrower.

@[youtube](i2dUM0qjhy4?start=68&end=250&rel=0) _(If you have problems watching the video, right click to open it in a new window)_

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
__2.1__ The thrower is an ex-sportsman, but which sport did he play?

* [x] American football
* [ ] Baseball
* [ ] Cricket  
* [ ] Darts
* [ ] Elephant Polo (yes, it’s a real sport, and more importantly it means that the answers start with an A, B, C, D and E).

---

The answer is American football, because the paper plane engineer keeps talking about the thrower being a ‘quarterback’.  

If you didn’t know that a quarterback is an American footballer, then a quick google would have solved the problem.

## 3.	Junior Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2013) Q17 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
![](/resources/7-06-build-your-own-plane/3-square-question.jpg){image align="right"}
__3.1__ A 5 cm × 5 cm square is cut into five pieces, as shown.  

Each cut is a sequence of identical copies of the same shape but pointing up, down, left or right.  

Which piece has the longest perimeter?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [x] E
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=1
If we look at pieces B and C, they have roughly the same perimeter – let’s call it 12 lengths. However, B has a longer perimeter than C, because more of B’s sides are crooked, and crooked sides are longer than straight sides.
^^^

---

We let the length of each crooked line be `x` cm. Since this crooked line is longer than the side length of one of the squares, 1 < `x`.  

The perimeters of the five pieces are, in centimetres:

* A: 4 + 6`x`  
* B: 2 + 10`x`  
* C: 7 + 5`x`  
* D: 6 + 6`x`  
* E: 1 + 11`x`  

As 1 < `x`, E has the longest perimeter.

## 4.	QI

The BBC TV show “QI” is full of interesting facts and ideas. Here are a few interesting bits from “QI” and some follow-up questions.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=2
__4.1__ “It takes a million cloud droplets to make one raindrop.”  

Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water, which gather together to form raindrops, which in turn fall to Earth. If the cloud droplets have a radius of 0.002 mm, then what is the radius of a raindrop (based on the idea that a million droplets make a drop)?

* [ ] 0.002 mm
* [x] 0.2 mm
* [ ] 2 mm
* [ ] 20 mm
* [ ] 2,000 mm
{.col-5}

---

If it takes one million droplets to make a drop, then you can imagine that the drop is made of 100 droplets across, 100 droplets up and 100 droplets deep, because 100 × 100 × 100 = 1 million.

And, 100 × 0.002 mm = 0.2 mm.

::: problem id=4_2 marks=2
![](/resources/7-06-build-your-own-plane/4-clouds.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.2__ You might need to do some research to answer this question: what is the weight of a cumulus cloud?

* [ ] The same as a mouse.
* [ ] The same as a cat.
* [ ] The same as a lion.
* [ ] The same as an elephant.
* [x] The same as a blue whale.

---

A typical cumulus cloud weighs about 500 tons, and a blue whale is a couple of hundred tons or more.

::: problem id=4_3 marks=2
__4.3__ “A million seconds is 11.6 days”  

How long is a billion seconds?

* [ ] A few days
* [ ] A few weeks
* [ ] A few months
* [x] A few decades
* [ ] A few centuries

---

1,000,000,000 / (365 × 24 × 60 × 60) = 31.7 years
:::

::: problem id=4_4 marks=2
__4.4__ What happened roughly a million days ago?

* [ ] Universe is formed
* [ ] Earth is formed
* [ ] Atlantic Ocean is formed
* [x] Roman kingdom is formed
* [ ] United States is formed

---

1,000,000 / 365 = 2,721 ago, or roughly 720 BC
:::

::: problem id=4_5 marks=4
__4.5__ “The Sun gets 4 billion kilogrammes lighter every second.”  

Einstein’s famous formula is:  

__`E = mc^2`__  

It explains how mass (`m`) can be turned into energy (`E`) at the rate of (`c^2`) per kilo.  

`c` is the speed of light, which is `3 × 10^8` m/s.  

So, 1 Kg creates `1 × (3 × 10^8)^2` Joules of energy, or `9 × 10^16` Joules of energy.  

Bearing in mind the QI quote, roughly how much energy does the Sun generate every second?

* [ ] `4 × 10^16` Joules
* [ ] `4 × 10^17` Joules
* [ ] `4 × 10^20` Joules
* [x] `4 × 10^26` Joules
* [ ] `4 × 10^35` Joules

^^^ hint id=4_4 marks=1
Energy per second `= m × c^2`  
`= 4 × 10^9 × (3 × 10^8)^2`  
^^^

---

Energy per second `= m × c^2`  
`= 4 × 10^9 × (3 × 10^8)^2`  
`= 4 × 10^9 × 9 × 10^16`  
`= 36 × 10^25`  
`= 3.6 × 10^26`  
`~ 4 × 10^26`

#5. Maths Jokes

Can you match the mathematical joke to the correct punchline?

* __Punchline A:__ Because seven, eight, nine!
* __Punchline B:__ When I got back, he’d only done jobs one, three, five, and seven.
* __Punchline C:__ The farmer says, “But I’ve counted them and I’ve only got 36!” The sheepdog replies, “I know, but I rounded them up.”

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next time.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	It’s half-term, so the next Parallelogram is at 3pm on Thursday, 31st October.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
