## 1. 

Many card tricks can be explained with a bit of maths.  

In this video you will see the trick performed.  

Watch through to the end to see how the deck must be prepared beforehand.  

We will then get into the explanation of why it works.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ If the spectator chooses 35, what card does this correspond to?  

* [ ] 3 of Clubs
* [x] 8 of Clubs
* [ ] 8 of Spades
* [ ] 3 of Hearts

---

For the tens digit, 1 = Spades, 2 = Hearts, 3 = Clubs, 4 = Diamonds.  

The sum of the two digits gives the value of the card (3 + 5 = 8 in this case).
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ If a spectator’s card turns out to be the 5 of Hearts, what number must they have chosen?

* [ ] 5
* [x] 23
* [ ] 32
* [ ] Impossible to determine

---

Since it is a Hearts, the tens digit is 2.  

Since the digits add up to 5, the Ones digit must therefore be 3.

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ Which of these cards can NOT be revealed in this trick?  

* [ ] 3 of Spades
* [ ] 3 of Clubs
* [x] 3 of Diamonds
* [ ] Every card can be revealed depending on the number chosen

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1
If the spectator chooses a Diamonds then their tens digit is a 4.
^^^

---

If the spectator chooses a Diamonds then their tens digit is a 4 and the value of the card, which is the sum of their two digits, already exceeds 3.  

So 3 of Diamonds is impossible.
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ The trick works because the cards are set up in a particular way.  

First you create 4 piles - one for each of the 4 suits (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds).  

How many cards are in these 4 piles? 

* [x] 10 each
* [ ] 13 each
* [ ] 8, 9, 10, 11 respectively
* [ ] 9, 10, 11, 12 respectively

^^^ hint id=1_4_1 marks=1
The piles consist of:  
* Spades: Ace to 10
* Hearts: 2 to Jack
* Clubs: 3 to Queen
* Diamonds: 4 to King
^^^

---

Each suit corresponds to a range of 10 numbers (10-19 for Spades, 20-29 for Hearts, 30-39 for Clubs, 40-49 for Diamonds), so we need 10 cards for each of the 4 piles.  

They are:
* Spades: Ace to 10
* Hearts: 2 to Jack
* Clubs: 3 to Queen
* Diamonds: 4 to King

## 2. Tricky problems

<!--- PMC (2020) Q10 --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
![](/resources/6-46-any-number/2-1-pentagon.png){image align="right"}
__2.1__ The diagram shows a pentagon with a square placed edge to edge with it.  

George places another square on each of the other four edges of the pentagon.  

How many outside edges does the combined shape now have?

* [ ] 13
* [ ] 14
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17

---

Each square contributes three edges to the resulting shape, so the polygon will have 3 × 5 = 15 edges.
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2 
__2.2__ A ten foot pole casts an eight foot shadow.  

How long is a pole which casts a twelve foot shadow, in feet?

<input type="number" solution="15"/>  

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
The height of an object is directly proportional to its shadow, and the proportion is `10/8`.
^^^

---

The height of an object is directly proportional to its shadow, and the proportion is `10/8`.  

So the length of the pole is `10/8 × 12 = 15` feet.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
*   This was our last Parallelogram of the year, but be sure to come back in September for more puzzles and problems.

Cheerio,
Simon.
