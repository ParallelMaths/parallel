Beatrix takes a sheet of paper, shown here labelled A.  

She then folds the sheet in half 4 times, and punches a hole all the way through the folded sheet, as shown here labelled B.  

She then unfolds the sheet.  

How many holes are there now in the unfolded sheet?

* [ ] 4
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 12
* [x] 16

If the sheet of paper had been folded in half once then there would have been two holes in the unfolded sheet.  

Each additional fold doubles the eventual number of holes in the unfolded sheet so after four folds there will be sixteen holes.
