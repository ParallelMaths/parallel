*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Keep on rolling!

Circles, famously, roll pretty well.  

Watch this video where Matt Parker joins two circles to make a wobbly shape, which still rolls surprisingly well.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ When rolling a circle, what happens to its center of mass?  

* [x] It stays at a constant height
* [ ] It moves up and down
* [ ] It remains in contact with the surface its rolling on

__1.2__ When rolling a square, what happens to its center of mass?  

* [ ] It stays at a constant height
* [x] It moves up and down
* [ ] It remains in contact with the surface its rolling on

__1.3__ In the wobbly circles, where is the center of mass?  

* [ ] It changes from one center to the other
* [x] The midpoint between the centers
* [ ] It has two centers of mass

__1.4__ On a penny farthing bicycle the big wheel has a circumference of 3m and the small wheel has a circumference one quarter the size of the big wheel.  

After the bike has traveled 9m, what is the total number of revolutions of both wheels combined?  

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 4
* [x] 15
* [ ] 0

---

Wheels turn along their circumference, so after 9m the big wheel has completed `9 / 3 = 3` revolutions.  

The small wheel, however, has a circumference one quarter the size, so `3/4`m or 75cm.  

900cm / 75cm = 12 revolutions.  

So in total the wheels have turned 3 + 12 = 15 revolutions.

## 2. Going round in circles.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ In the diagram, the smaller circle touches the larger circle and also passes through its centre.

What fraction of the area of the larger circle is the smaller circle?  

* [ ] The small circle is half the area of the large
* [ ] The small circle is one third the area of the large
* [x] The small circle is one quarter the area of the large
* [ ] The small circle is one sixth the are of the large

---

First think of a square: if we half the length, what happens to the area?  

A 6cm square has an area of 36cm<sup>2</sup>, if we half that length we get a 3cm square with area 9cm<sup>2</sup>.  

So the area has been quartered!

We can apply this to the circle too, if we half the diameter we will quareter the area (because it is both half the width AND the height of the original circle).  

You might also be able to look at this dagram and convince yourself (correctly) that the shaded area is equivalent to the area of the smaller circles.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
