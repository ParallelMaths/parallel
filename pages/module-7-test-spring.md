## 1.
::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the lowest common multiple of 12 and 13?  

<input type="number" solution="156"/> 

---

12 and 13 are coprime so we simply multiply the two numbers: 12 × 13 = 156.
:::


## 2.
::: problem id=2_1 marks=1 
The interior angles of a regular polygon sum to 1440°.  

How many sides does the polygon have?  

<input type="number" solution="10"/> 

---

If N is the number of sides, then the internal angles sum to (N – 2) × 180°, which means (N – 2) × 180 = 1440 . Solve this to get N = 10.
:::


## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4 and there are 15 boys, how many students are there altogether?   

* [ ] 20
* [ ] 25
* [ ] 30
* [x] 35
* [ ] 40
{.col-5}

---

15 boys represent `3/(3+4) = 3/7` of the total number of students.  

So the total number of students is 7/3 × 15 = 35.
:::


## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
Which of these is prime?

* [ ] 873
* [ ] 879
* [ ] 891
* [x] 887
* [ ] 897
{.col-5}

---

887 is prime. All the others are divisible by 3 (sum the digits and use the divisibility check for 3).
:::


## 5.
::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/5-diagram.jpg){image align="right"}
Which of these statements follows from the diagram?   

* [ ] X = Y
* [ ] X = Y + Z
* [ ] X + Y + Z = 188°
* [x] X + Y + Z = 172°
* [ ] X = Z

---

Angles at a point sum to 360°, therefore  

X + Y + Z = 360° – 139° – 49° = 172°.
:::



## 6.
::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
Which of these is largest? 

* [x] `4^4`
* [ ] `3^5`
* [ ] `5^3`
* [ ] `6^2`
* [ ] `2^6`
{.col-5}

---

The values, respectively, are  

* `4^4 = 256`
* `3^5 = 243`
* `5^3 = 125`
* `6^2 = 36`
* `2^6 = 64`
:::


## 7.
::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
What number must be removed from the set {4, 6, 12, 15, 23} to leave a mean of 14?   

* [x] 4
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 15
* [ ] 23
{.col-5}

---

The total of all five numbers is 60 and, once a number is removed, we are left with four numbers.  

Those four numbers have a mean of 14 if their total is 56. So we must remove the 4.  
:::


## 8.
::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what is the probability that you get the same number twice?   

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [x] `1/6`
* [ ] `1/36`
* [ ] `1`
{.col-5}

---

Whatever you roll on the first die, the second die has six possible values, only one of which matches the first roll.  
So the probability of getting a match is `1/6`.
:::


## 9.
::: problem id=9_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/9-square.png){image align="right"}  
A square is cut into two rectangles, as shown, so that the sum of the lengths of the perimeters of these two rectangles is 48.  

What is the area of the square?   

* [ ] 24 
* [ ] 36
* [ ] 48
* [x] 64
* [ ] 100
{.col-5}

---

Label the two short sides of the rectangles `x` and `y`, as shown.  

![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/9-square-answer.png){image align="center"}

Then the two rectangles have a combined perimeter of `6(x + y)`, so the side length of the square, `x + y`, is `48/6 = 8`.  

So the area of the square is `8 × 8 = 64`.  
:::


## 10.
::: problem id=10_1 marks=1
![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/10-parallelogram.png){image align="right"} 
Which of these statements is true concerning the parallelogram?

* [ ] Area A = Area C 
* [ ] Area B = Area D
* [ ] Area A + Area B = Area C + Area D
* [x] Area A + Area C = Area B + Area D
* [ ] Area A = Area B = Area C = Area D

---

* Let the height of triangle B be h₁ and the height of triangle D be h₂. The base of the parallelogram is equal to the base of these two triangles – call it b.  
* Then the area of the parallelogram is b × (h₁ + h₂) and  
* Area B + Area D = ½ × b × h₁ + ½ × b × h₂ = ½ × b × (h₁ + h₂)  
* Therefore Area B + Area D makes up half the parallelogram, so it must be equal to Area A + Area C.

## 11.
::: problem id=11_1 marks=1
In a special sale, items that are already half price are halved again.  

But they still won’t sell, so the manager takes off another 20%.  

What percentage of the original price are the items now?  

* [ ] 10%
* [ ] 12.5%
* [ ] 15%
* [x] 20%
* [ ] 25%
{.col-5}

---

If the original price is `p`, then the final price is 0.8 × 0.5 × 0.5 × p = 0.2p, which is 20% of the original price p.
:::


## 12.
::: problem id=12_1 marks=1
How many fractions between `1/10` and `1/5` inclusive can be written with a denominator of 25? 

<input type="number" solution="3"/>

---

`1/10 = 5/50 = 2.5/25` and  
`1/5 = 10/50 = 5/25`,  

therefore the relevant fractions are `3/25`, `4/25` and `5/25`.
:::


## 13.
::: problem id=13_1 marks=1
Ayliean cruised at 60 miles for the first three hours of a journey, then flew along at 75 miles per hour for the remainder of the journey.  

Her average speed for the whole journey was 70 miles per hour.  

How long, in hours, did Ayliean’s journey take?  

<input type="number" solution="9"/>

---

Let the time for which Ayliean drove at 75 mph be `t` hours.  

Then the total distance covered was `(60 × 3 + 75t)` miles.  

Also, as her average speed over `3 + t` hours was 70 mph, the total distance travelled was `70(3 + t)` miles.  

Thus `180 + 75t = 210 + 70t`, which we can solve to get `t = 6`.  

So the total length of the journey is 3 + 6 = 9 hours.  
:::


## 14.
::: problem id=14_1 marks=1
For any fixed value of x, which of the following four expressions has the smallest value?  

* [x] `(x + 1)(x - 1)`
* [ ] `(x + 1/2)(x - 1/2)`
* [ ] `(x + 1/3)(x - 1/3)`
* [ ] `(x + 1/4)(x - 1/4)`
* [ ] Depends on the value of `x`

---


Using the difference of two squares, `(x – a)(x + a) = x^2 – a^2`.  

The expression in `(x + 1)(x - 1)` takes away the largest value from `x^2` and is therefore the smallest.
:::



## 15.
::: problem id=15_1 marks=1
Four of these points lie on the same circle.  

Which point does not lie on that circle?  

* [ ] (-6, 8)
* [ ] (-10, 0)
* [ ] (0, 10)
* [x] (5, 5)
* [ ] (8, 6)
{.col-5}

---

For points A, B, C and E, the `x` and `y` co-ordinates satisfy.  

`x^2 + y^2 = 100`,  

which means they lie on a circle with centre (0, 0) and radius 10.  

For the point (5, 5), `x^2 + y^2 = 50`, so it does not lie on this circle.
:::


## 16.
::: problem id=16_1 marks=1
When I increase a number by 10% I get twice as much as when I decrease 7 less the number by 10%.  

What is that number?  

<input type="number" solution="18"/>

---

Let `a` be the number, then  

`1.1a = 2 × 0.9(a – 7)`

Rearrange this equation to get `0.7a = 1.8 × 7`, which can be solved to get `a = 18`.  
:::


## 17.
::: problem id=17_1 marks=1
What is the remainder when 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! + 7! + 8! + 9! + 10! is divided by 6?

<input type="number" solution="3"/>

---

Every term from 6! onwards is obviously divisible by 6 and leaves no remainder.  

5! also has a factor of 6 (as it has factors of 2 and 3) and likewise for 3!  

So the only terms left to consider are 1! + 2! + 4! = 27, and this leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 6.
:::


## 18.
::: problem id=18_1 marks=1
In the grid shown the three non-zero numbers in each row, each column and each diagonal multiply to give the same product.  

What is the value of `x`?  

![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/18-grid.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="50"/>

---

Let the missing value on the bottom row be `n` and the value above the 10 be `m`.  

Then `10mn = 10n`, therefore `m = 1`.  

Let the value in the top right be `y`.  

Then `xy = 50y`, so `x = 50`.  
:::


## 19.
::: problem id=19_1 marks=1
A shop sign says, “T-shirts. Four for the price of three. Equivalent to a saving of £7.50 on each T-shirt.”  

Using this special offer, what is the cost of four T-shirts?  

* [ ] £30
* [ ] £45
* [ ] £60
* [x] £90 
* [ ] £120
{.col-5}

---

As buying four T-shirts for the price of three is equivalent to a saving of £7.50 on each T-shirt, the money saved using this offer is 4 × £7.50 = £30.  

The money saved is the cost of one T-shirt so this cost is £30.  

So, using the offer, the cost of three T-shirts is 3 × £30 = £90.

![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/20-semicircle.png){image align="right"}
A circle is inscribed in a semicircle with centre O and diameter AB.  

The centre of the circle is the point P, where PA = PO.  

What is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the semicircle?  

* [ ] 3:8
* [ ] 4:9
* [x] 9:64
* [ ] 4:25
* [ ] 1:4

---

Let the radii of the semicircle and circle be R and r respectively.  

Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to triangle OCP gives:  

`(R – r)^2 = (R/2)^2 + r^2`  

which can be rearranged to give `r = 3R/8`.  

![](/resources/module-7-test-spring/20-semicircle-answer.png){image align="center"}

So the ratio of the two areas is `πr^2:πR^2` and since `r^2/R^2 = 9/64`, this simplifies to 9:64.
