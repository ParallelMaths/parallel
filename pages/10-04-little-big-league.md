These challenges are a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics, most of which will be nothing to do with what you are doing at the moment in your classroom. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas, including a few questions that appear to have nothing to do with mathematics at all.

## 1. Little Big League

In the 1994 film “Little Big League”, a 12-year-old boy called Billy suddenly becomes the manager of the Minnesota Twins baseball team. In this clip, Billy has to solve a maths problem for his homework before he can focus on the rapidly approaching baseball game.

A player comes up with a correct solution, but it is not very well explained, so let’s try a similar problem.  

Suppose Mr Smith can paint the entire house in 12 hours, and Mrs Smith takes just 8 hours to paint the same house. How long would it take the Mr and Mrs Smith working together to paint the house?

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ First, which of the following answers is correct?

* [ ] Working together, they will take even more time than the slower painter.
* [x] Working together, they will take even less time than the faster painter.
* [ ] Working together, they will take less time than the slower painter, but more time than the quicker painter.

::: problem id=1_2 marks=4
__1.2.__ How long will it take Mr and Mrs Smith to paint the house if they work together?  

Give your answer in minutes (not hours and minutes).

<input solution="288"/>

^^^ hint id=1_2 marks=1
How much of the house can Mr Smith paint in 1 hour, and how much of the house can Mrs Smith paint in 1 hour? So, working together, how much of the house can they paint in 1 hour?
^^^

If it takes Mr Smith 12 hours to paint a house, then he paints `1/12` of a house per hour.  

If it takes Mrs Smith 8 hours to paint a house, then she paints `1/8` of a house per hour.  

Together they paint `1/12 + 1/8 = 5/24` of a house per hour.  

This means they will take `24/5` hours to paint the house.  

(This previous step sometimes makes me scratch my head. Imagine they can paint `1/3` of a house in 1 hour, then it will take them `3/1` (or 3) hours to paint the whole house.)  

`24/5` hours = 4.8 hours = 240 minutes + 48 minutes = 288 minutes.

## 2. Proving √2 is irrational

Two weeks ago, I mentioned that a follower of Pythagoras was executed for proving that `sqrt(2)` is an irrational number. But, you might be wondering, how does someone prove that a number is a irrational. How can you prove that a number cannot be written down as a fraction or a ratio?  

Here is an outline of such a proof, but...  

__WARNING – this proof is not simple. You will have to think carefully about each and every step.__  

This type of proof is known as a ‘proof by contradiction’, which means we are going to start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. So, we are going to “try” to prove that `sqrt(2)` is rational! By trying to prove this, we should discover something that would be impossible, which means that our starting point (`sqrt(2)` is rational) must have been impossible.  

Let’s get going.  

Let's imagine that it is possible to come up with such a ratio to produce `sqrt(2)`.  

In fact, __make this the simplest ratio you can have__ - cancelling out any common factors. Remember this. __No common factors__.

Let's call it `A/B`.

So, `A/B` = `sqrt(2)`

We know that `A` and `B` could not both be even, because they would then have a common factor of 2, which we would have cancelled out already.

Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation by itself, so

`A^2/B^2 = 2`

Next multiply both sides by `B^2`, ending up with

`A^2 =2B^2`

This means that `A^2` must be an even number - because 2 times anything is even.

And that makes `A` an even number too – because it cannot be an odd number, bearing in mind that an odd number multiplied by itself is always odd.

So, let’s say `A = 2a`, and let’s plug it into the equation and simplify.

`(2a)^2 = 2B^2`

`4a^2 = 2B^2`

`2a^2 = B^2`

This means that `B^2` must be an even number - because 2 times anything is even.

And that makes `B` an even number too – because it cannot be an odd number, bearing in mind that an odd number multiplied by itself is always odd.

So, let’s say `B = 2b`, and let’s plug it into the equation and simplify.

`2a^2 = B^2`

`2a^2 = (2b)^2`

`2a^2 = 4b^2`

Let’s re-arrange a bit more…

`a^2 = 2b^2`

`a^2/b^2 = 2`

`a/b` = `sqrt(2)`.

Wow! We started out by saying `A/B` was the simplest way to represent `sqrt(2)`, but now we know that `a/b` = `sqrt(2)`, and we know that `a` and `b` are only half of `A` and `B`. So we have a simpler ratio for `sqrt(2)`… but we started off saying we were already at the simplest ratio.

We have contradicted ourselves, so our initial attempt to represent `sqrt(2)` as a fraction must be impossible.

CONCLUSION – this proof is tricky, and you need to follow it carefully, but hopefully get a sense of how mathematicians know that `sqrt(2)` is irrational.

<!--- (2016) Q4 --->

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ Amrita is baking a cake on a Thursday. She bakes a cake every fifth day.  

How many days will it be before she next bakes a cake on a Thursday?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 25
* [x] 35
{.col-5}

---

Amrita bakes a cake again after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 days and so on. Thursdays come after 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days and so on. The first number which appears in both of these lists is 35. So Amrita next bakes a cake on a Thursday after 35 days.

__4.1__ The net shown consists of squares and equilateral triangles. The net is folded to form a rhombicuboctahedron, as shown.  

![](/resources/10-04-little-big-league/11-net.jpg){image align="center"}  

When the face marked `P` is placed face down on a table, which face will be facing up?

* [ ] C
* [x] D
* [ ] E

The diagram shows a vertical cross-section through the centre of the rhombicuboctahedron when it is placed so that the face marked `P` is face down.  

The cross-section cuts through a ring of eight square faces. These are the eight square faces that form the central band of the net. They are labelled as shown. We see from the diagram that the face `D` will be facing up.
