# Good Thinking

Good Thinking is a charity founded by Simon Singh, and you can [visit its website](http://goodthinkingsociety.org/) for more information.

In short, the charity promotes science and challenges pseudoscience. Its support of the Top-Top Set Project and the Parallel Project show that it is committed to support maths education, which in turn supports science education.
