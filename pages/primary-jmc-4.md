::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
Nadiya is baking a cake.  The recipe says that her cake should be baked in the oven for 1 hour and 35 minutes.  

She puts the cake in the oven at 11:40 am.  

At what time should she take the cake out of the oven? 

* [ ] 12:15 pm
* [ ] 12:40 pm
* [ ] 1:05 pm
* [x] 1:15 pm
* [ ] 2:15 pm
{.col-5}

---

After an hour, it is 12.40pm. Then add another 35 minutes to get 1.15pm.

Which of these fractions is nearest to 1?

* [ ] `5/6`
* [ ] `6/7`
* [ ] `7/8`
* [ ] `8/9`
* [x] `9/10`
{.col-5}

---

The fractions get larger, left to right, because we are adding 1 to each of the numerator and denominator.

## 4.
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
In California, a bottle of orange juice costs $3, but when you return the bottle, you get $2 back.  

What is the largest number of bottles you can buy if you start with $10?  

* [ ] 3
* [ ] 6
* [x] 8
* [ ] 9
* [ ] 10
{.col-5}

Buying a bottle of juice, drinking the juice and returning the bottle, involves a net cost of $1.00.  

Therefore, after doing this seven times, you will have $3 left, ie just sufficient to buy an eighth bottle.  

After drinking the juice of returning this bottle, you will have $2.00 left, but this is not enough to buy a 9th bottle.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
Each cell in the crossnumber below contains a single non-zero digit. The answer to each clue is a two-digit number.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [x] 9
{.col-5}

The solution to 3 across is an odd square.  The only two-digit odd squares are 25, 49, and 81.  

The solution to one down is a square, but no squares have a unit digit of 2 or 8. So 1 down is 64 and 3 across is 49.  

Hence `x` = 9.  

Checking the remaining of the cross number, we note that 1 across is a square which has a tens digit of 6 and therefore is 64.  Finally, we note that 2 down is now 49, which is indeed a square.
