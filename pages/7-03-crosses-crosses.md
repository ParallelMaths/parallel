1. a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.
2. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
   mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
   young mathematicians.

</div>

Welcome to the third of our Parallelograms designed for Year 7 students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons more squiggly.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
*	Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.
*	Make sure you complete every challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.


This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in six parts.

__IMPORTANT__ – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct answer).

__IMPORTANT__ – some questions have a hint (sometimes two hints). Please think hard and try hard before resorting to the hint. The hints will help you get the right answer, but you will lose marks.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (2e)

The Junior Maths Challenge is a national maths competition run the UK Maths Trust, and many of you might be entering this year. Ask your teacher, and her or she will know whether you or your class will be entering. Each week, the Parallelograms will contain one or two Challenge questions from the tests given in previous years.

What is the remainder when the following numbers are divided by 9?

::: problem id=1_1 marks=0.5
__(1)__ 152

<input type="number" placeholder="???" x-input="p_3_2, 1"></input>

---
You should know that there is an easy test to see if a number is divisible by 9. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, then the actual number is also divisible by 9. Anything left over is the remainder.

152 is not divisible by 9, because 1+5+2=8, which is obviously divisible by 9. But 9-8=1, so the remainder is 1.
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=0.5
__(2)__ 9876543210

<input type="number" placeholder="???" x-input="p_3_2, 0"></input>

---
9876543210 is divisible by 9, because the digits add up to 45 which is divisible by 9 (as well as knowing our times tables, we know 45 is divisible by 9 because 4+5=9).

You might have noticed that the digits in this number can also be paired, so that each pair adds up to 9 (9+0, 8+1, 7+2, 6+3, 5+4), so all the digits must add up to a multiple of 9.
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__(2)__ 555…555, which is 5 written out 2011 times in a row

<input type="number" placeholder="???" x-input="p_3_2, 2"></input>

---
It is easy to add up the digits of 5 written out 2,011 times. It is just 5 x 2,011, or 10,055. Is that divisible by 9? Well, 1+0+0+5+5= 11, so it is not divisible by 9 and the remainder is 2.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (3)

A train display shows letters by lighting cells in a grid, such as the letter ‘o’ shown. A letter is made bold by also lighting any unlit cell immediately to the right of one in the normal letter.

![](resources\7-03-crosses-crosses\3-lights-question.png)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
How many cells are lit in a bold ‘o’?

* [ ] 22
* [x] 24
* [ ] 26
* [ ] 28
* [ ] 30

---
The only thing to do here is to draw (or imagine) the figure corresponding to a bold ‘o’, and to count the number of cells that are lit. We see that the extra cells that need to be lit are then 10 cells shown in black. This makes 24 lit cells altogether.

## 3. Tic-tac-toe or nought and crosses

Mathematicians love playing games. In fact, there is a whole area of maths known as Game Theory, which looks at everything from Monopoly to poker to chess to football to warfare. You can apply maths to understand maths and to work out the best strategy for winning.

In this Parallelogram, we have a video that looks at one of the simplest games, noughts and crosses, or tic-tac-toe as it is known in some countries.
If you have half a brain, then you will know how to play noughts and crosses and never lose (and sometimes win if you are playing against a 5-year-old. So, this video looks what happens if you change the rules. Professor Thane Plambeck shows you how to become world champion at a version that only involved crosses.

Watch it carefully, pause it if necessary and think about it carefully. If you understand how to win at the crosses only version of noughts and crosses, then challenge your friends and family and see if you are truly unbeatable. Also, remember to answer the question below.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
In the Misere version of crosses and crosses, if you really want to win, then start in the centre and move that is more usual in chess. Which move is it?

* [ ] Pawn move
* [ ] Bishop move
* [ ] Rooke move
* [x] Knight move
* [ ] Queen move

## 4. The race

Can you solve the following riddle?
::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
  You’re running a race and pass the person in 2nd place. What place are you in now?

  * [ ] First place
  * [x] Second place
  * [ ] Third place

---

Most people say 1st, because it feels as if you are now better than the 2nd place person, so you might be 1st. But think about it for a moment and you will realise you are 2nd for all sorts of reasons:
* If you overtook 2nd then you must have been in 3rd place, and moving up one place means you are now second.
* You are now better than the 2nd place person, that person has slipped back to 3rd place, so you are now the 2nd place person.
* The only way to be 1st is to overtake the 1st place person, and you have not done that yet, so you can’t be in 1st place.

## 5. Decoding Caesar

Last week, we discussed how you can encode a message by turning it into a number according to the alphabet-number list below, adding a number and then turning the new number back into a letter.

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
| 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
{.grid}

| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
{.grid}

So, if we encode by (+2), then CAT is 2-0-19, adding 2 turns it into 4-2-21, which means CAT is encoded as ECV.

If, we encode by (+10), then CAT is 2-0-19, adding 10 turns it into 12-10-29. The number 29 is tricky, because no letter is associated with 29, so last week we talked about modulo arithmetic. In this case of modulo (26), if we have a number that is outside our range of 0 to 25, then we add or subtract 26 again and again until we are within the range of 0 to 25. This means that 12-10-29 becomes 12-10-3, which means CAT is encoded as MKD.

If you need to revise this, then go back and look at the [previous Paralellogram](/pages/7-02-marie-curie.md##5).

But what about __decoding__? You can decode a word by subtracting, instead of adding.

A word has been encoded by adding 15 and the result is RDL. To decode it, turn the encoded word into numbers, which is 17-3-11, then subtract 15, which turns it into 2-(-12)-(-4). The problem is that neither (-12) nor (-4) are not in our range of 0-25, so we add 26 so that -12 becomes +14, and -4 becomes +22. So now we have 2-14-22, which is the word COW.

Now try these decoding challenges.

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
| 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
{.grid}

| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
{.grid}

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
__5.1.__ CBU is the result after a word was encoded with +1. First, turn CBU into numbers.

* [ ] 3-2-21
* [x] 2-1-20
* [ ] 1-0-19

:::

::: problem id=5_2 marks=1
__5.2.__ Next, if you apply the correct decoding mathematical step, the result is:

* [ ] 2-1-20
* [x] 1-0-19
* [ ] 0-25-18
:::

::: problem id=5_3 marks=1
__5.3.__ Finally, enter the three letters of your decoded word.

<input type="text" placeholder="???" x-input="p_5_3, BAT"></input>

---
Answer: BAT
:::

::: problem id=5_4 marks=1
__5.4.__ NTG was encoded with +8. If we turn NTG into numbers we get 13-19-6. Next, if you apply the correct decoding mathematical step, the result is:

* [ ] 18-27-14
* [ ] 10-19-6-8
* [x] 5-11-(-2)

:::

::: problem id=5_5 marks=1
__5.5.__ Finally, enter the three letters of your decoded word.

<input type="text" placeholder="???" x-input="p_5_5, FLY"></input>

---
Answer: FLY
:::

::: problem id=5_6 marks=2
__5.6.__ BKT was encoded with +2,622. Turn BKT into a number, and apply the correct decoding mathematical step (subtract 2,622) to get:

* [ ] (-5)-8-25
* [x] (-2,621)-(-2,612)-(-2,603)
* [ ] 2,623-2,632-2,641
:::

::: problem id=5_7 marks=2
__5.7.__ In the previous step, your sequence on numbers might be outside of the range of 0 to 25, so you will need to add or subtract 26 again and again (is there a quick way to do this?) to any problematic numbers, until they fall within the right range. What is your result?

* [ ] 21-8-25
* [ ] 6-8-26
* [x] 5-14-23
* [ ] 23-6-15
* [ ] 6-1-18
* [ ] 18-8-13

:::

::: problem id=5_8 marks=2
__5.8.__ Finally, enter the three letters of your decoded word.

<input type="text" placeholder="???" x-input="p_5_8, FOX"></input>

---

The early questions (5.1 to 5.3) were easy, and some of you might have been able to jump straight to the answer BAT, without going through each mathematical step. However, it is important to understand the step-by-step method in order to prepare for the harder questions.

With 5.4 and 5.5, the tricky step is dealing with correct answer to 5.4, which is 5-11-(-2). The allowable range is 0 to 25, so we have to add 26 to (-2) to get 24. So we are now dealing with 5-11-24, which is FLY.

Step 5.6 requires you to subtract 2,622, which leaves you with three large negative numbers, namely (-2,621)-(-2,612)-(-2,603). You could try adding 26 again and again, but the short cut is to spot that these numbers are close to -2,600, which is -100 x 26. So we can jump to trying to deal with (-21)-(-12)-(-3). Add 26 to these and we get 5-14-23, which is FOX.

## 6. Amazing James Randi and his rope trick
![](resources\7-03-crosses-crosses\3-james-randi.jpg)
One of my heroes is James Randi, who is often known as the Amazing Randi. In the last few decades he has become a champion of rationality and a debunker of nonsense, but he started off in show business as a magician and an escapologist.

Well after becoming a pensioner, Randi was performing escapology. See you can work how he escapes from ropes in the video below.

I hope you enjoyed this Parallelogram, the third one of 2018. You can find the answers and go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday. This is really important. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something knew.

Cheerio,
Simon.
