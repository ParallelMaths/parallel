This is the fifth of our six special Summer Parallelograms, designed to keep your maths brain busy over the summer. You can do all the Parallelograms in a day (!), or a week, or you can spread them out across the summer holidays. All six need to be completed by September 1.

Unlike our usual Parallelograms, these summer questions don’t involve any videos. Instead, all the questions have been taken from old Junior Maths Challenge papers. That means none of the questions are easy and some of them will be very tough.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears. The answer sheet (with explanations) will appear as soon as you hit the submit button.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
Each letter in the abbreviation __UKMT__ is rotated through 90° clockwise.

Which of the following could be the result?

* [ ] A ![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/1-ukmt-question1.gif)
* [ ] B ![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/1-ukmt-question2.gif)
* [ ] C ![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/1-ukmt-question3.gif)
* [ ] D ![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/1-ukmt-question4.gif)
* [x] E ![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/1-ukmt-question5.gif)

---

In A, the letter T is incorrect; in B it is U which is incorrect; in C and D the incorrect letters are M and K respectively.

The diagram shows a pattern of 16 circles inside a square.

The central circle passes through the points where the other circles touch.

The circles divide the square into regions. How many regions are there?

* [ ] 17
* [ ] 26
* [ ] 30
* [x] 32
* [ ] 38
{.col-5}

---

Each of the five outer circles is divided into six regions, giving 30 regions in total. In addition, there is one region in the centre of the diagram and one region between the circles and the sides of the square. So, in all, there are 32 regions.

## 3.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/3-triangle-question.gif){image align="right"}
In a triangle which has the angles `x°`, `y°`, `z°` the mean of `y` and `z` is `x`.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 90
* [ ] 80
* [ ] 70
* [x] 60
* [ ] 50
{.col-5}

---

If the mean of `y` and `z` is `x`, then `y + z = 2x`. So the sum of the interior
angles of the triangle is `(x + y + z) ° = 3x°`. So `3x = 180`, that is `x = 60`.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/4-angles-question.gif){image align="right"}
In the diagram shown, all the angles are right angles and all the sides are of length 1 unit, 2 units or 3 units.

What, in square units, is the area of the shaded region?

* [ ] 22
* [ ] 24
* [x] 26
* [ ] 28
* [ ] 30
{.col-5}

---

Divide the whole figure into horizontal strips of height 1 unit: its area is (3 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 3) units<sup>2</sup> = 42 units<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, the unshaded area is (1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1) units<sup>2</sup> = 16 units<sup>2</sup>. So the shaded area is 26 units<sup>2</sup>.

Alternative solution: notice that if the inner polygon is moved a little, the answer remains the same – because it is just the difference between the areas of the two polygons. So, although we are not told it, we may assume that the inner one is so positioned that the outer shaded area can be split neatly into 1 by 1 squares – and there are 26 of these.

## 5.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
The Severn Bridge has carried just over 300 million vehicles since it was opened in 1966.

On average, roughly how many vehicles is this per day?

* [ ] 600
* [ ] 2,000
* [ ] 6,000
* [x] 20,000
* [ ] 60,000
{.col-5}

---

The average number of vehicles per day ≈ `(300,000,000)/(44 × 365)` ≈ `(300,000,000)/(40 × 400)` ≈ `(300,000,000)/16,000` ≈ `(300,000,000)/15,000` = 20,000

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/6-triangle-question.gif){image align="right"}
The lengths, in cm, of the sides of the equilateral triangle `PQR` are as shown.

Which of the following could not be the values of x and y?

* [ ] (18, 12)
* [ ] (15, 10)
* [ ] (12, 8)
* [x] (10, 6)
* [ ] (3, 2)

---

As triangle `PQR` is equilateral, `x + 2y = 3x - y = 5y - x`. Equating any two of these expressions gives `2x = 3y`.

The only pair of given values which does not satisfy this equation is `x = 10`, `y = 6`.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=2
Nicky has to choose 7 different positive whole numbers whose mean is 7.

What is the largest possible such number she could choose?

* [ ] 7
* [x] 28
* [ ] 34
* [ ] 43
* [ ] 49
{.col-5}

---

The seven numbers must total 49 if their mean is to be 7. The largest possible number will occur when the other six numbers are as small as possible, that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So the required number is 49 - 21 = 28.

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=3
![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/8-dots-question.gif){image align="right"}
A single polygon is made by joining dots in the `4 × 4` grid with straight lines, which meet only at dots at their end points. No dot is at more than one corner.

The diagram shows a five-sided polygon formed in this way.

What is the greatest possible number of sides of a polygon formed by joining the dots using these same rules?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 15
* [x] 16
{.col-5}

---

![](/resources/2018summer-8-5/8-dots-answer.gif){image align="right"}
The number of sides of the polygon is equal to the number of corners it has. As no dot is at more than one corner, the maximum number of corners is 16. So the maximum possible number of sides is 16, provided that a 16-sided figure may be drawn.

The figure on the right shows one of several ways in which this can be achieved.

And that’s the end of the fifth Summer Parallelogram. Thanks for taking part. Don’t forget to get started on the next one when you have a bit of spare time.

Cheerio,
Simon.
