# Chess conundrum

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

__1.1__ All of the Forty Thieves were light-fingered, but only two of them were caught red-handed.  

What percentage is that?

* [ ] 2
* [x] 5
* [ ] 10
* [ ] 20
* [ ] 50
{.col-5}

---
`2/40 = 1/20 = 5/100 = 5%`

__2.1.__  Mr Owens wants to keep the students quiet during a Mathematics lesson. He asks them to multiply all the numbers from 1 to 99 together and then tell him the last-but-one digit of the result.

What is the correct answer?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 9
{.col-5}

---

As 2, 5 and 10 are all factors of the correct product, this product is a multiple of 100. So the last digit and the last-but-one digit are both zero.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ One of the examination papers for Amy’s Advanced Arithmetic Award was worth 18% of the final total. The maximum possible mark on this paper was 108 marks.

How many marks were available overall?

* [ ] 420
* [ ] 480
* [ ] 540
* [ ] 560
* [x] 600
{.col-5}

---

As 108 marks represented 18% of the final total, 6 marks represented 1% of the final total. So this total was 600.

__4.1.__ In the diagram on the right, `PT = QT = TS`, `QS = SR`, `∠PQT = 20°`.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 20
* [ ] 25
* [ ] 30
* [x] 35
* [ ] 40

^^^ hint id=4_1
Since `PT = QT`, `PTQ` is an isosceles triangle, so `∠QPT = 20°`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_2
Since `QS = SR`, `QSR` is an isosceles triangle as well, so `∠QRS = x°`. Now consider the angles which form triangle `PQR`.

As `QS = SR`. `∠SRQ = ∠SQR = x°`.

So `∠QST = 2x°` (exterior angle theorem). Also `∠TQS = 2x°` since `QT = TS`.

As `PT = QT`, `∠TPQ = ∠TQP = 20°`.

Consider the interior angles of triangle `PQR`: `20 + (20 + 2x + x) + x = 180`.

So `4x + 40 = 180`, hence `x = 35`.

## 5. Can You Solve This Chess Conundrum?

This puzzle was featured on the BBC TV show “QI”. First, you need to know that the knight in chess moves in an L-shape, as shown in the image below. “L” means 2 squares left/right and 1 up/down, or 2 up/down and 1 left/right. The below diagram shows all of the spaces the knight could move to next.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=4
__5.1__ What is the maximum number of knights that you can place on a chess board (8 x 8 squares), so that none of the knights can take any other knight?

<input solution="32"/>

^^^ hint id=5_1
When a knight starts on a black square, what colour squares can it attack? Only black? Only white? Black and white?
^^^

This QI clip explains why the answer is 32 knights.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
