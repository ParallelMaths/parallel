* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday night if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Classic Countdown

Take a look at this classic number game from Countdown.

Here is an explanation of what happened by Junaid Mubeen, Director of Education, at Whizz Education, who was also a Countdown octochamp.

<!--- (2003) Q6 --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ Think of a number, double it, then add 3. Multiply your answer by 4 and from this take away 5. Now also take away the number you first thought of. No matter what your first number was, your answer will always be a multiple of:

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 5
* [x] 7
* [ ] 11
{.col-5}

---

Let the number thought of be `x`. Then the final number is `4 (2x + 3) - 5 - x = 7x + 7 = 7(x + 1)`.

<!--- (2003) Q9 --->
::: problem id=3_1 marks=4
__3.1__ It has been estimated that the mass of insects caught by spiders in a year in the UK is equal to the mass of the human population of the UK. Assuming this population is 60 million and the average mass of a human is 70kg, what is the mass, in tonnes, of insects caught by spiders per year in the UK?

* [ ] 4.2
* [ ] 42
* [ ] 4200
* [ ] 420000
* [x] 4200000
{.col-5}

---

60 million × 70 kg = 4200 million kg = 4.2 million tonnes, since 1 tonne = 1000 kg.

__4.1__ The diagram shows three semicircles, each of radius one.  

What is the size of the total shaded area?

* [x] `π + 2`
* [ ] `3`
* [ ] `3/2π + 1`
* [ ] `4`
* [ ] `2π - 1`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=2
Redraw the diagram as shown below and the problem becomes much easier.

The shaded area may be divided into a 2 × 1 rectangle plus a semicircle and two quarter circles, all of radius 1.  

Hence the total area is that of the rectangle plus that of a circle of radius 1, ie 2 + π.

## 5.
<!--- (2003) Q20 --->
::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
__5.1__ Suppose that `e`, `i`, `n` and `t` represent different positive whole numbers, `n + i + n + e = 9`, `t + e + n = 10` and `i = 1`.  

What is `t`?

* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [x] 5
* [ ] 6
{.col-5}

---

We are given that `2n + e = 8` and `t + e + n = 10`. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives `t - n = 2`.  

As `n` cannot equal 1, the minimum value of `t` is 4 but this gives `n = 2`, `e = 4` which is impossible.  

If `t = 5` then `n = 3` and `e = 2`, which is allowed. If `t > 5` then `n > 3` and `e` is not a positive whole number, so 5 is the only possible value of `t`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
