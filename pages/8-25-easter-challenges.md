*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## Junior Maths Challenge (UKMT) Mock

Some of you will be doing the UKMT’s Junior Maths Challenge on 30th April, so this Parallelogram consists of __25__ Junior Maths Challenge questions – some easy, some tricky. This is an opportunity to get some practice before the real JMC. And, if you are not doing the JMC, then it is an excellent way to develop your maths skills.

The real JMC allows you one hour to attempt 25 questions, so in theory you have roughly sixty minutes to complete these 25 questions. However, don’t rush, don’t guess and don’t worry if you need longer than sixty minutes.

Here are a few things to bear in mind when you do the real JMC:
* you may not use a calculator.
* the first half of the questions are not too tricky (__also true below__).
* the second half of the questions are really tricky (__also true below__).
* you will lose marks for wrong answers in the second half of the questions (__not true below__).

So don’t take wild guesses for the second half of the questions in the real JMC, and don’t take wild guesses for trickier questions below. However, if you have a rough idea of the answer or have narrowed it down to a couple of possible answers, then it is worth picking an answer.

__Make sure you have a paper and pencil to hand for sketches and calculations.__

Because this Parallelogram is longer and tougher than a typical Parallelogram, we will be awarding TREBLE POINTS for this week's answers! So there's even more reason to give this one your best shot.

Finally, afterwards, make sure you go through all the answers and see where you went right and where you went wrong. This is 100% the best way to improve your maths skills.

__The next Parallelogram will contain our usual mix of videos, humour, puzzles and problems.__


## 1.

__1.1__ What is the smallest four-digit positive integer which has four different digits?

* [ ] 1032
* [ ] 2012
* [ ] 1021
* [ ] 1234
* [x] 1023
{.col-5}

---

Here it is easy just to check the options that are given. A, D and E are the only options in which all four digits are different. Of these, clearly, E is the smallest.

For a complete solution we need to give an argument to show that 1023 really is the smallest four digit positive integer with four different digits. It is easy to do this.

To get the smallest possible number we must use the four smallest digits, 0, 1, 2 and 3. A four digit number cannot begin with a 0. So we must put the next smallest digit, 1, in the thousands place, as a four-digit number beginning with 2 or 3 is larger than one beginning with a 1. For similar reason the
hundreds digit must be the smallest remaining digit, 0. Similarly the tens digit must be 2 and the units digit must be 3.

So the required number is 1023.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=5
__2.1__ Nadiya is baking a cake. The recipe says that her cake should be baked in the oven for 1 hour and 35 minutes. She puts the cake in the oven at 11:40 am.  

At what time should she take the cake out of the oven?

* [ ] 12:15 pm
* [ ] 12:40 pm
* [ ] 1:05 pm
* [x] 1:15 pm
* [ ] 2:15 pm
{.col-5}

---

1 hour and 35 minutes is 1 hour plus 20 minutes plus 15 minutes.  

One hour after 11:40 am the time is 12:40 pm. After a further 20 minutes, the time is 1 pm. Then 15 minutes later it is 1:15pm.  

Therefore 1 hour and 35 minutes after 11:40 am the time is 1:15 pm.

__3.1__ Which of the following has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself?
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 8
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 19
* [x] 25
{.col-5}

---

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6; the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8; the factors of 13 are 1 and 13; the factors of 19 are 1 and 19; and the factors of 25 are 1, 5 and 25. We see from this that, of the numbers we are given as options, only 25 has exactly one factor other than 1 and itself. It is worth noticing that 25 is the only square number.

* [ ] `1/2`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/9`
* [ ] `1/10`
* [x] `1/20`
{.col-5}

---

When the download is 95% complete, 5% remains to be downloaded.

Now 5% means 5 parts in 100. Therefore, expressed as a fraction, 5% is `5/100 = 1/20`.

__6.1__ In a magic square, the numbers in each row, each column and the two main diagonals have the same total. This magic square uses the integers 2 to 10.  

Which of the following are the missing cells?

__Method 1:__ The row totals given by the numbers shown in the square in the question are 10 + 5 = 15, 8 + 4 = 12 and 7 + 2 = 9. Therefore to make all the row totals the same, the number we add to the second row must be three more than the number we add to the first row, and the number we add to the third row must be three more than the number we add to the second row.  

Therefore the only possibility for the missing cells among the given options is that given by option D.  

As the square on the right shows, when we add these missing cells, the row totals, the column totals and the totals on the two main diagonals are all equal to 18. So option D is correct.  

__Method 2:__ The numbers in the completed magic square have total 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 54. This is the sum of the three row totals. Since these row totals are equal, each row total in the magic square is 54 ÷ 3 = 18. To achieve these totals from the numbers already shown in the square in the question, the numbers that need to be added to the three rows are 3, 6 and 9 in this order from top to bottom. So the correct option is D.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=5
__7.1__ A small ink cartridge has enough ink to print 600 pages. Three small cartridges can print as many pages as two medium cartridges. Three medium cartridges can print as many pages as two large cartridges. How many pages can be printed using a large cartridge?

* [ ] 1200
* [x] 1350
* [ ] 1800
* [ ] 2400
* [ ] 5400
{.col-5}

---

Three small cartridges have enough ink for `3 × 600 = 1800` pages. So 1800 is the number of pages that two medium cartridges can print. Hence one medium cartridge can print `1/2` (1800) = 900 pages. So three medium cartridges have enough ink for `3 × 900 = 2700` pages. So 2700 is the number of pages
that two large cartridges can print. Hence one large cartridge can print `1/2` (2700) = 1350 pages.

An alternative, algebraic method, is to let `m` be the number of pages that a medium cartridge can print, and `l` be the number of pages that a large cartridge can print. From the information we are given we
have the equations `3 × 600 = 2m` and `3m = 2l`.

From these we can deduce that `l` = `3/2` `m` = `3/2` `×` `(3 × 600)/2` `= 9 × 150 = 1350`.

__8.1__ The diagram shows a rectangle `PQRS`, with point `T` on `PS` such that `QT` is perpendicular to `RT`.  

The length of `QT` is 4 cm. The length of `RT` is 2 cm.  

What is the area of the rectangle `PQRS`?

* [ ] 6 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [x] 8 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 10 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 12 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 16 cm<sup>2</sup>
{.col-5}

---

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:  

`1/2 `(base × height)  

whereas the area of a rectangle is given by  

base × height.  

The triangle `QRT` and the rectangle `PQRS` have the same base, `QR`, and the same height.  

It follows that the area of the rectangle `PQRS` is twice the area of the triangle `QRT`.  

Because `QT` is perpendicular to `RT`, if we take `QT` as the base of the triangle `QRT`, its height is given by the length of `RT`. Hence the area of the triangle `QRT` is:

`1/2 (QT × RT) = 1/2 (4 cm × 2 cm) = 4 cm^2`.

Hence the area of the rectangle PQRS is:

`2 × 4 cm^2 = 8 cm^2`.

__9.1__ The diagram on the right shows the positions of four people (each
marked `x`) in an Art Gallery. In the middle of the room is a stone
column. Ali can see none of the other three people. Bea can see only
Caz. Caz can see Bea and Dan. Dan can only see Caz.

Who is at position `p`?

* [ ] Ali

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/9-gallery-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
The person in position `p` is the only one who can see two of the others.
We are told that Caz can see Bea and Dan but everyone else can see
just one other person or no-one. So it must be Caz who is at position `P`.

We can also see that Ali, who can see no-one, must be in the position
shown. Bea and Dan must be in the other two positions, but the
information we are given doesn't enable us to work out which is where.

## 10.

::: problem id=10_1 marks=5
__10.1__ Which of the following integers is not a multiple of 45?

* [ ] 765
* [ ] 675
* [ ] 585
* [ ] 495
* [x] 305.
{.col-5}

---

Because 45 = 5 × 9, if an integer is divisible by 45, it is divisible both by 5 and by 9. Conversely, if an integer is divisible both by 5 and by 9, then, because 5 and 9 have no common factors other than 1, the integer is also divisible by 45.  

Each of the integers 765, 675, 585, 495 and 305 has units digit 5, and therefore is divisible by 5.  

The test for whether an integer is divisible by 9 is whether the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.  

We see that 7 + 6 + 5 = 18, 6 + 7 + 5 = 18, 5 + 8 + 5 = 18 and 4 + 9 + 5 = 18. Because 18 is divisible by 9 we deduce that all of the first four integers given as options are divisible by 9.  

However 3 + 0 + 5 = 8 and so the sum of the digits of 305 is not divisible by 9.  

We deduce that 305 is the only one of the given options that is not divisible by 45

## 11.

::: problem id=11_1 marks=5
__11.1__ In the following expression each ▲ is to be replaced with either + or - in such a way that the result of the calculation is 100.

123 ▲ 45 ▲ 67 ▲ 89  
{.text-center}

The number of + signs used is `p` and the number of - signs used is `m`. What is the value of `p` - `m` ?

* [ ] -3
* [x] -1
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 3
{.col-5}

---

One approach is trial and error, as there are only a few combinations. For example, if it is (+ 45) then it is hard to see how we obtain a result of 100. So, we can then explore (- 45). Following this approach quickly leads you to the correct answer, but there is also a more rigorous and mathematical approach.

The sum is made up of 123 and ± 45, ± 67and ± 89. Suppose that the total of the positive terms in the calculation is `x` and the total of the negative terms is `y`. So `x > 0` and `y < 0`. We need to have that:

`x + y = 100`.
{.text-center}

We also have that:

`x - y = 123 + 45 + 67 + 89 = 324`.
{.text-center}

Adding these equations, we obtain `2x = 424`. So `x = 212` and hence `y = -112`. It is readily seen that `45 + 67 = 112` and that no other combination of 45, 67 and 89 gives a total of 112. So the correct calculation must be `123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100` with 1 plus sign and 2 minus signs. So `p = 1` and
`m = 2`, giving `p - m = -1`.

__12.1__ Last year, at the school where Gill teaches Mathematics, 315 out of the 600 pupils were girls. This year, the number of pupils in the school has increased to 640. The proportion of girls is the same as it was last year.  

How many girls are there at the school this year?

* [ ] 338
* [ ] 337
* [x] 336

---

The fraction of girls in the school last year was `315/600`. By dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3 and then by 5 we see that  

`315/600 = 105/200 = 21/40`.  

The proportion of girls this year is the same. Therefore, of the 640 pupils in the school this year, the number that are girls is:  

`21/40 × 640 = 21 × 16 = 336`.

Let the input factors be `p, q, r, s` and `t` along the top row, and `v, w, x, y` and `z` in the first column, as shown in the grid on the right.

We see that `wp = 15` and `xp = 18`, so that `p` is a divisor of both 15 and 18, and hence is either 1 or 3. However, if `p = 1`, then it would follow that `w = 15`. But this is not possible as `wr = 40`. We deduce that `p = 3`. It follows that `w = 5` and `x = 6`. Since `w = 5` and `wr = 40`, we have that `r = 8`.

Therefore, as `zr = 56`, `z = 7`. Also, as `x = 6` and `xs = 60`, `s = 10`. ![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/13-grid-answer2.jpg){image align="right"} Since `vs = 20`, it follows that `v = 2`. Then, as `vq = 10`, `q = 5`. Hence, as `yq = 20`, we have that `y = 4` . Finally, as `yt = 24`, we deduce that `t = 6`.

This enables us to complete the table, as shown on the left. (Though, really, we need only to calculate the diagonal entries that we have shown in bold.)

Therefore, we have `A + B + C + D + E = 6 = 25 + 48 + 40 + 42 = 161`.

Since half the 60 bulbs are yellow, 30 are yellow and 30 are not yellow. One third of the 30 bulbs that are not yellow are red, so 10 are red and 20 are neither yellow nor red. One quarter of the 20 that are neither yellow nor red, are pink. So 5 bulbs are pink.

This leaves 15 bulbs which are neither yellow, nor red nor pink. So there are 15 white bulbs. Therefore the fraction of bulbs that are white is `15/60`, that is, `1/4`.

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/15-grid-answer1.png){image align="right"}

The two lines of reflection symmetry of the grid are shown in the figure on the right as broken lines.  

We see from this that if the grid with some of the small squares shaded grey has both these lines of reflection symmetry, then all the four squares labelled P must be the same colour. Similarly, all the four squares labelled Q must be the same colour, the two squares labelled R must be the same colour, and the two squares labelled S must be the same colour.  

It follows that there are only three ways in which Mathias can shade exactly four of the small squares of the grid grey so that the result has two lines of reflection symmetry. These are:  

(i) shade grey all the squares labelled P, and no others,  
(ii) shade grey all the squares labelled Q, and no others,  
and (iii) shade grey all the squares labelled R and all those labelled S, and no others.  

The three different grids that Mathias could produce are shown in the figure below.

Suppose there are `g` girls and `b` boys in Miss Spelling's class. As there are 6 more girls than boys, `g - b = 6`. As there are 24 pupils altogether, `g + b = 24`. Adding these equations gives `2g = 30`, so `g = 15`. Hence `b = 15 - 6 = 9`. So the ratio `g:b` is `15:9` which is the same as `5:3`.

We label the stations as shown in the diagram on the right so that we can refer to them. Jo can visit the stations in the order:  

`O, P, Q, R, S, R, T, X, Y, Z, Y, X, W, V, U`.  

In this way she visits all the stations and goes through just three of them, `R`, `Y` and `X` more than once.  

It remains only to show that Jo cannot visit all the stations without going through at least three of them more than once.  

Jo must go through the junction stations `R` and `X` more than once. If Jo does not start or finish at `O`, she will have to go through `P` more than once. If she does not start or finish at `U` she will have to go through `V` more than once. If she starts at `O` and finishes at `U`, or vice versa, she will have to go through `Y` more than once. It follows that Jo has to go through at least three stations more than once. So this is the smallest number of stations Jo must go through more than once.

Let `∠QSR` `= x°`. Since `PS` is parallel to `QR`, the alternate angles `∠PQS` and `∠QSR` are equal. So `∠PQS` `= x°`. Therefore, as `∠PSQ`:`∠PQS` `= 1:5`, `∠PSQ` `= 1/5 x°`. Therefore, from the right angled triangle `PQS` we deduce that `x + 1/5 x + 90 = 180` and so `6/5 x = 90`. Therefore `x = 5/6 × 90 = 75`.

So `∠QSR` is 75°.

__20.1__ Dominic wants to place the six dominoes above in a hexagonal ring so that, for every pair of adjacent dominoes, the numbers of pips match. The ring on the right indicates how one adjacent pair match.

There are only two 1-pip dominoes among the six Dominic has. These must therefore be adjacent. Likewise for the two 2-pips, the two 6-pips and the two 4-pips. So the ring must include the three adjacent dominoes:

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/20-dominoes-answer1.jpg){image align="center"}

and also the three adjacent dominoes:

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/20-dominoes-answer2.jpg){image align="center"}

The ring may now be completed two ways, i.e., by connecting top-left 5-pip to bottom-left 5-pip and the top-right 5-pip to bottom-right 5-pip … or by connecting top-left 5-pip to bottom-right 5-pip and the top-right 5-pip to bottom-left 5-pip.

We therefore see that Dominic can create two different rings of six dominoes, as shown below.

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/20-dominoes-answer5.jpg){image align="center"}

We now see that there are just 2 dominoes that the [1:5] domino cannot be adjacent to, namely the domino [2:5] and, of course, the domino [4:6].

__22.1__ Peter wrote a list of all the numbers that could be produced by changing one digit of the number 200. How many of the numbers in Peter's list are prime?

* [x] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
{.col-5}

If the hundreds or tens digit of 200 is changed, but the units digit is unchanged, the resulting number is, like 200, a multiple of 10, and so cannot be prime. So we need only consider the 9 numbers that we can get by changing the units digit. Of these, we can see immediately that 202, 204, 206 and 208 are all divisible by 2 and 205 is divisible by 5. So none of them is prime.

This just leaves 201, 203, 207 and 209. Now:  
`201 = 3 × 67`,   
`203 = 7 × 29`,  
`207 = 3 × 3 × 23` and  
`209 = 11 × 19`.

None of them are prime, so none of the numbers in Peter's list are prime.

__23.1__ Sam wants to complete the diagram so that each of the nine circles contains one of the digits from 1 to 9 inclusive and each contains a different digit.  

Also, the digits in each of the three lines of four circles must have the same total.  

What is this total?

* [ ] 17
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 19
* [x] 20
* [ ] 21

We suppose that `x`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are the numbers in the circles, as shown in the diagram. These numbers are the digits 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.

Let the common total of the digits in the three lines be `k`.

Then: `(x + a + b + 5) + (x + e + f + 2) + (5 + c + d + 2) = 3k`,  

that is, `(x + a + b + c + d + e + f ) + x + 14 = 3k`.  

Now `x + a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 38`  

and therefore  

`52 + x = 3k`.  

![](/resources/8-25-easter-challenges/23-circles-answer2.png){image align="right"}
It follows that `52 + x` is divisible by 3. Now `x` is one of 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the only one of these possible values for which 52 + `x` is divisible by 3 is `x` = 8. This gives 52 + `x` = 60.  

Hence `60 = 3k`, and so `k = 20`.   

In the context of the JMC, we can stop here. But to give a full mathematical solution we should satisfy ourselves that it is possible to place the digits in the circles so that each line adds up to 20.  

One way this can be done is shown in the diagram opposite.

__24.1__ The interior angles of a triangle are `(5x + 3y)`°, `(3x + 20)`° and `(10y + 30)`°, where `x`, `y` are positive integers.

What is the value of `x + y`?

* [x] 15
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 12
* [ ] 11

---

Crucially, the question said that x and y are positive __integers__.  

The angles of a triangle add up to 180°. So `(5x + 3y) + (3x + 20) + (10y + 30) = 180`. This gives `8x + 13y + 50 = 180`. Therefore `8x + 13y = 130`, and so

`8x = 130 - 13y = 13(10 - y)`.
{.text-center}

It follows that `8x` is a multiple of 13 and hence, as 8 and 13 have no common factors, it must be that `x` is a multiple of 13. So `x = 13a`, where `a` is a positive integer. It then follows that

`8(13a) = 13(10 - y)`
{.text-center}

and so, cancelling the factor 13

`8a = 10 - y`
{.text-center}

and hence `10 - y` is a positive number which is a multiple of 8. The only positive value of `y` for which `10 - y > 0` and `10 - y` is a multiple of 8, is `y = 2`, which gives `a = 1` and hence `x = 13`. So `x + y = 13 + 2 = 15`.

__25.1__ A die has the shape of a regular tetrahedron, with the four faces having 1, 2, 3 and 4 pips. The die is placed with 4 pips ‘face down’ in one corner of the triangular grid shown, so that the face with 4 pips precisely covers the triangle marked with 4 pips.  

The die is now ‘rolled’, by rotating about an edge without slipping, so that 1 pip is face down. It is rolled again, so that 2 pips are face down, as indicated. The rolling continues until the die rests on the shaded triangle in the opposite corner of the grid.  

How many pips are now face down?

* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] it depends on the route taken

We first consider what happens if one vertex of the tetrahedral die remains fixed on the grid and the die rolls about this fixed point. In doing this the die covers in succession six faces making up a hexagon. The faces adjacent to the fixed vertex are each face down twice in this hexagon. If the die is rolled about any of the edges on the perimeter of the hexagon, the remaining face is then face down. This is shown in the diagram on the right for the case where the faces with 1, 2 and 3 pips are adjacent to the fixed vertex, and the remaining face has 4 pips on it.

The pattern shown above can be extended to the whole of the given triangular grid, as shown in the diagram on the right. (Indeed, this pattern could be extended to a triangular grid filling the entire plane.)  

For any triangle in the grid, the face then face down together with the two preceding faces form part of a hexagon, and determine the orientation of the die. (Here, by the orientation of the die, we mean the positions of all four of its faces.) The die can roll to this triangle across any of its edges. However, the pattern implies that the same face is face down in all these cases. In particular, the face with 1 pip is face down when the die reaches the shaded triangle.
