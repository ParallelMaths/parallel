It’s the end of Christmaths, so here is your last instalment of your Christmaths maths challenge paper!

Simon.

The sum of two numbers is 2. The difference between them is 4. What is their product?

* [ ] -8
* [x] -3
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 8
{.col-5}

---

Let the numbers be `x` and `y`. Then `x + y = 2`; `x - y = 4`. Adding these equations gives `2x = 6`, so `x = 3`. Hence `y = 2 - 3 = -1` so the numbers are 3 and -1.

What is the mean of `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4` and `1/6`?

* [ ] `1/5`
* [ ] `1/15`
* [ ] `5/12`
* [ ] `7/24`
* [x] `5/16`
{.col-5}

---

The four fractions total `5/4`, so their mean is `5/4 ÷ 4 = 5/16`.

Only one of these triangles can actually be made.

![](/resources/10-17-chrismaths/15-triangles.png){image align="center"}

Which is it?

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [x] D
* [ ] E
{.col-5}

---

As triangle A has two equal sides, it should have two equal angles, but its angles are 25°, 110° and 45° so it is impossible to make.  

In a triangle, the smallest angle lies opposite the shortest side which makes B impossible since 20° is the smallest angle, but 5 cm is not the shortest side.  

Triangle C is impossible as `4^2 + 7^2 ≠ 8^2`, so it does not obey Pythagoras' Theorem.  

The longest side of a triangle must be shorter than the sum of the other two sides, but this is not the case in triangle E, so it cannot be made either.  

Triangle D, however, is obtained by cutting an equilateral triangle of side 6cm in half along an axis of symmetry and so can certainly be made.

What is the largest power of 2 that divides `127^2 - 1`?

* [ ] `2^1`
* [ ] `2^7`
* [x] `2^8`
* [ ] `2^63`
* [ ] `2^127`
{.col-5}

---

Using the formula for the difference of two squares:  

`127^2 − 1 = 127^2 − 1^2 = (127 + 1)(127 − 1) = 128 × 126 = 2^7 × 2 × 63 = 2^8 × 3^2 × 7`.

The diagram shows a square with two lines from a corner to the middle of an opposite side.  

The rectangle fits exactly inside these two lines and the square itself.  

What fraction of the square is occupied by the shaded rectangle?

* [ ] A) `1/3`
* [x] B) `2/5`
* [ ] C) `3/10`
* [ ] D) `1/2`
* [ ] E) `3/8`
{.col-5}

Triangles `ABG`, `GFE` and `EFA` are similar, so `AF : FE = EF : FG = GB : BA = 1 : 2`.  

Thus if `AF = a`, then `FE = 2a`, `FG = 4a`, and the shaded area is `8a^2`.  

By Pythagoras' Theorem, `AE = sqrt(5)a`, so `AD = 2 sqrt(5)a` and the area of the square is `20a^2`.  

Thus the required fraction is `8/20`, which is `2/5`.

Alternatively, as we have shown that `FG = 4AF`, we can divide parallelogram `AGCE` into 10 congruent triangles, 8 of which make up rectangle `EFGH`.  

So the area of the rectangle is `4/5` of the area of the parallelogram, which in turn is half the area of square `ABCD`.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
