This is the third of our special Summer parallelograms.

* Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
* But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Your score, answers and explanations will be displayed as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
What is the remainder when 354972 is divided by 7?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5

---
Note that 7 divides 35, 49 and 7, so it divides 354970. So the remainder is 2.

## 2.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=1
When the following fractions are put in their correct places on the number line, which
fraction is in the middle?

* [x] -`1/7`
* [ ] `1/6`
* [ ] -`1/5`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] -`1/3`

---

When put in their correct places on the number line, the order of the fractions
is: -`1/3`, -`1/5`, -`1/7`, `1/6`, `1/4`.

In the diagram on the right, `ST` is parallel to `UV`.

What is the value of `x`?

* [ ] 46
* [ ] 48
* [x] 86
* [ ] 92
* [ ] 94

As `ST` is parallel to `UV`, `∠PRT = 132°` (corresponding angles).

So `∠PRQ = 48°` (angles on a straight line).

From the exterior angle of a triangle theorem, `∠SQP = ∠QPR + ∠PRQ`, so `x = 134 - 48 = 86°`.

## 4.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
The six-member squad for the Ladybirds five-a-side team consists of a 2-spot ladybird, a 10-spot, a 14-spot, an 18-spot, a 24-spot and a pine ladybird (on the bench). The average number of spots for members of the squad is 12. How many spots has the pine ladybird?

* [x] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 8

---

The total number of spots which the six ladybirds have is `6 × 12 = 72`. So
the number of spots which the pine ladybird has is `72 - (2 + 10 + 14 + 18 + 24) = 4`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-3/5-numbers-question.gif){image align="right"}
I choose three numbers from this number square, including one number from each row and one number from each column. I then multiply the three numbers together.

What is the largest possible product?

* [ ] 72
* [ ] 96
* [x] 105
* [ ] 162
* [ ] 504

---

We consider the different possible choices from the top row. If 1 is chosen, then the options are 1, 5, 9 and 1, 6, 8 giving products 45 and 48 respectively.

If 2 is chosen, the options are 2, 4, 9 and 2, 6, 7 giving products 72 and 84 respectively.

Finally, if 3 is chosen, the options are 3, 4, 8 and 3, 5, 7 giving products 96 and 105. So 105 is the maximum.

## 6.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=1
![](/resources/2018summer-3/6-jmc-question.gif){image align="right"}
The letters `J`, `M`, `C` represent three different non-zero digits.

What is the value of `J + M + C`?

* [ ] 19
* [x] 18
* [ ] 17
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 15

---
The hundreds column shows us that `J = 1` or `2`. [We can’t carry more than 2
from the units to the tens; and 2 plus the biggest feasible values 7, 8, 9 for the
three letters is only 26.]

The units column shows that `J + M` is a multiple
of 10 and it can’t be 0 (or else `J + M = 0`); so `J + M = 10` and `M = 9` or `8` respectively.

Also, the sum of the units column is `10 + C`, so there is exactly `1` to carry to the tens column. The tens column now tells us that `J + C + 1 = 10J`. So `J = 2` is not possible and therefore `J = 1`, `C = 8` and `M = 9`.

## 7.

::: problem id=7_1 marks=1
A list of ten numbers contains two of each of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The two 0s are next
to each other, the two 1s are separated by one number, the two 2s by two numbers, the two
3s by three numbers and the two 4s by four numbers. The list starts 3, 4, ... . What is the
last number?

* [ ] 0
* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4

---
Let the list be `3, 4, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h`. We can see that `c = 3` and `e = 4`. So the list now reads `3, 4, a, b, 3, d, 4, f, g, h`.

Now, the only pairs of letters two apart from each other are `a, d` and `d, g`. Therefore `d = 2` and the list is `3, 4, a, b, 3, 2, 4, f, g, h`.

The only pair now one apart are `f, h`. The list is `3, 4, a, b, 3, 2, 4, 1, g, 1`.

Now `a, b` are the only pair zero apart. So `a = b = 0` and `g = 2`

## 8.

::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
The pages of a book are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... . In total, it takes 852 digits to number all the
pages of the book. What is the number of the last page?

* [ ] 215
* [ ] 314
* [x] 320
* [ ] 329
* [ ] 422

---
Pages 1 to 9 inclusive require 9 digits; pages 10 to 99 inclusive require 180 digits. So, in total, 189 digits are required to number all of the pages before the three-digit page numbers commence with page number 100.

This leaves 663 digits, so the last page in the book is the 221st page which has a three-digit number, namely page 320.
