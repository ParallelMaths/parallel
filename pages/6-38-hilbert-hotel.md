*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Welcome to the Hilbert Hotel

You have just arrived at the Hilbert Hotel and are ready to start your richly deserved vacation.  

You soon realise this is no ordinary hotel - it has infinitely many rooms and infinitely many guests!  

Things are about to get even stranger when a new guest arrives.  

Watch as Emily Riehl explains the strange arithmetic of infinity using the example of the Hilbert Hotel.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ How is the new guest accommodated at the Hilbert Hotel?

* [ ] They have to share a room with a randomly chosen guest
* [ ] A new room is built for them on the spot
* [x] Every guest moves to the next room along
* [ ] They have to sleep in the lounge

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ What is infinity + 1,000,000?

* [x] Still the same infinity
* [ ] A larger infinity
* [ ] A smaller infinity
* [ ] It is impossible to say

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ When the new guests arrive from the second Hilbert Hotel, they can all still be accommodated.  

Where does the guest in room 123 end up?

<input type="number" solution="246"/> 

^^^ hint id=1_3_1 marks=1 
To make space this time, every guest goes to twice their current room number.

## 2. Some puzzles!

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
![](/resources/6-38-hilbert-hotel/2-1-rectangle.jpg){image align="right"}
__2.1__ What fraction of the rectangle is shaded?
* [x] `1/3`
* [ ] `1/4`
* [ ] `2/5`
* [ ] `3/8`
* [ ] `2/9`

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1 
The fraction that is not shaded is `1/2` + `1/6`.
^^^

---

Consider the parts that are not shaded.  

There are two such parts - the first is a triangle taking up half the rectangle, and the second is a smaller triangle taking up a sixth of the rectangle.  

So the total unshaded fraction is `1/2` + `1/6` = `2/3` .  

This means the shaded part takes up `1/3` of the rectangle.

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ Veronica rolls three six-sided dice.  

The product of the three numbers is 90.  

What is the sum of the three numbers?  

* [ ] 10
* [x] 14
* [ ] 18
* [ ] 90
* [ ] More information is needed.
{.col-5}

---

The numbers in play are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  

The only combination of three numbers from this list that gives a product of 90 (even allowing for repeats) is 6 × 5 × 3.  

So the sum of the three numbers is 6 + 5 + 3 = 14.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
