# To infinity and beyond

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Infinities on different levels

All infinities are equal, but some are more equal than others!  

Watch as mathematician Emily Riehl explains infinity in a few different ways.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What does the term finite mean?  

* [x] Not infinite
* [ ] Less than a trillion
* [ ] To find out
* [ ] Goes on forever
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ Can you fit infinitely many jars of glitter into the observable universe?

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No
* [ ] It depends on the size of the jar

^^^ hint id=1_2_1 marks=1
The observable universe has a finite amount of space.  
^^^
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ Does a beach have finitely or infinitely many grains of sand?

* [x] Finitely many  
* [ ] Infinitely many    
* [ ] Depends on the size of the beach  
* [ ] Depends on the size of the grains of sand  
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ How many beaches would you need to accumulate infinitely many grains of sand?

* [ ] Just one  
* [ ] A thousand  
* [ ] A million  
* [x] Infinitely many  
:::  


## 2. Some puzzles with smaller numbers!

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Which is the largest?  

* [ ] `0^5`
* [ ] `1^4`
* [ ] `2^3`
* [x] `3^2`
* [ ] `4^1`
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ How many of these calculations eaual 1?

* `1/2` + `1/2`
* `1/2` - `1/2`
* `1/2` × `1/2`
* `1/2` ÷ `1/2`  
  

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 4
{.col-4}

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
