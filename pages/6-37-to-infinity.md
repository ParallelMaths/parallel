# To infinity and beyond

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. Infinities on different levels

All infinities are equal, but some are more equal than others!  

Watch as mathematician Emily Riehl explains infinity in a few different ways.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ What does the term finite mean?  

* [x] Not infinite
* [ ] Less than a trillion
* [ ] To find out
* [ ] Goes on forever
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ When a new guest arrives at the already full infinite hotel, how do they create a space for them?

* [ ] The new guest go to the room at the end  
* [x] All the other guests move over one room  
* [ ] The new guest goes into a negative number room  
* [ ] The new guest shares a room  
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ What is infinity + 1?  

* [ ] It's not possible  
* [ ] Onefinity  
* [x] Still infinity  
* [ ] A light year  
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ There are infinitely many positive integers and infinitely many negative integers.  

And of course, when we combine all integers (positive, negative, zero) we still have infinitely many.  

Which infinity is the largest?  

* [ ] The infinity of positive integers  
* [ ] The infinity of negative integers  
* [ ] The infinity of all integers  
* [x] They're all the same  

^^^ hint id=1_4_1 marks=1
Can you put all the integers in a single list?  

It might help to alternate between positive and negative integers (and don't forget about 0).
^^^

---

The first three collections of integers can all be put in a list, so they all have a countable infinity.  

For all integers, the list can be as simple as: 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ... and so on. Emily did say infinities are weird!

## 2. Some puzzles with smaller numbers!

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ Which is the biggest?  

* [ ] `0^5`
* [ ] `1^4`
* [ ] `2^3`
* [x] `3^2`
* [ ] `4^1`
{.col-5}
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ How many of these calculations eaual 1?

* `1/2 + 1/2`
* `1/2 - 1/2`
* `1/2 x 1/2`
* `1/2 ÷ 1/2`  
  

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 4
{.col-4}

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
