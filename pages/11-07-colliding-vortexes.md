# Colliding vortexes

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

These challenges are a random walk through the mysteries of mathematics, most of which will be nothing to do with what you are doing at the moment in your classroom. Be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird ideas, including a few questions that appear to have nothing to do with mathematics at all.

* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
*	Finish by Sunday 27 Oct if your whole class is doing parallelograms.  

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then examine the solution sheet to learn from your mistakes.  

As most of you will have a half-term coming up, this Parallelogram is longer than usual and has a couple of extra questions. And your next parallelogram will be in __two weeks time on 31st October__, and it will be appropriately terrifying.


## 1. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2001) Q2 --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1__ A tourist attraction which opens every day needs 30,000 visitors per day on average to break even. Last week there were 120,000 visitors. What is the number of visitors needed this week to break even over the two-week period?

* [ ] 43,000
* [ ] 90,000
* [ ] 180,000
* [ ] 210,000
* [x] 300,000
{.col-5}

---

Over a two-week period, the required number of visitors is 14 × 30,000 = 420,000. Hence the number required this week is 420,000 = 120,000 = 300,000.

__2.1__ Which of the following is the best estimate for the number of seconds in a year?

* [ ] `3 × 10^4`
* [ ] `3 × 10^5`

There are 60 × 60 × 24 × 365 in a non-leap year. This is roughly equal to 60 × 60 × 20 × 400.

There are 60 × 60 × 24 × 365 in a non-leap year.  

This is roughly equal to `60 × 60 × 20 × 400`.  

`60 × 60 × 20 × 400 = 6 × 6 × 2 × 4 × 10^5 = 288 × 10^5 = 2.88 × 10^7`.

So `3 × 10^7` is the best estimate.

## 3.	Colliding vortexes

Science can be very beautiful, and it can also be hard work. This video from YouTube channel SmarterEveryDay, on colliding vortexes (or vortices, if you prefer), shows this brilliantly.  

By the way, a vortex is a mass of gas or liquid with a whirling or circular motion, such as a smoke ring.

__4.1__ The diagram shows that `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 3^2 + 4^2`.  

What is `1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 1999 + 2001 + 1999 + ... + 5 + 3 + 1`?

* [ ] `999^2 + 1000^2`
* [x] `1000^2 + 1001^2`
* [ ] `1999^2 + 2000^2`
* [ ] `2000^2 + 2001^2`
* [ ] none of these

^^^ hint id=4_1 marks=2
The general form of the example given is `1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n – 1) + ... + 5 + 3 + 1 = (n – 1)^2 + n^2`.
^^^

^^^ hint id=4_2 marks=2
The largest number in the sum in question is 2001, so we have `2n – 1 = 2001`, so `n = 1001`.

The general form of the example given is `1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n – 1) + ... + 5 + 3 + 1 = (n – 1)^2 + n^2`.  

The largest number in the sum in question is 2001, so we have `2n – 1 = 2001`, so `n = 1001`, which gives `1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 1999 + 2001 + 1999 + ... + 5 + 3 + 1 = 1000^2 + 1001^2`.

If the general form was not obvious to you, you could have tried `2 × 2` square or a `6 × 6` square to get some extra clues.

## 5. Prime numbers

Number theorists love to find formulas which generate prime numbers. You may have heard of Mersenne’s formula `2^p – 1`, where `p` is a prime number, which has generated the 18 largest known primes.  

Here is a simpler procedure which seems to generate prime numbers. Write a list of 3s, and end with the digit 1. For example, 31 is prime, so is 331, and so is 3,331.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ What is the smallest number of this type (lots of 3s ending with a 1) which is not prime?

<input solution="333333331"/>

^^^ hint id=2_1 marks=2
You may have a ‘factorise’ function on your calculator which could help here. On the Casio fx-83GT X, it is the second function of the button for degrees/minutes/seconds (o ’ ”).  

If not, you can use [https://isthisprime.com/3333331](https://isthisprime.com/3333331){target="_blank"} and replace the number at the end of the URL.

<!--- (2001) Q24 --->

::: problem id=6_1 marks=5
![](/resources/11-07-colliding-vortexes/6-magic-square.jpg){image align="right"}
__6.1__ A 4 by 4 'antimagic square' is an arrangement of the numbers 1 to 16 inclusive in a square, so that the totals of each of the four rows and four columns and two main diagonals are ten consecutive numbers in some order.  

The diagram shows an incomplete antimagic square.  

When it is completed, what number will replace the asterisk?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 8
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=6_1 marks=1
The totals of the top row and the completed main diagonal are 30 and 39 respectively and therefore the ten consecutive numbers in question are 30 to 39.
^^^

^^^ hint id=6_2 marks=1
The number in the bottom right-hand corner must be one of 1, 2, 8, 15 or 16. Taking 1 or 2 makes the diagonal (from top left to bottom right) add up to less than 30.
^^^

^^^ hint id=6_3 marks=1
Making the number in the bottom right-hand corner 15 or 16 makes the diagonal (from top left to bottom right) add up to greater than 39. Hence, 8 must go in the bottom right-hand corner.
^^^

^^^ hint id=6_4 marks=1
If 15 is placed in the vacant square in the second column, we get a total of 45 for that column, which is too big. Try putting the 15 in another vacant square.
^^^

---

The totals of the top row and the completed main diagonal are 30 and 39 respectively, and therefore the ten consecutive numbers in question must be those from 30 to 39 inclusive.  

The number in the bottom right-hand corner must be one of 1, 2, 8, 15 or 16. Taking 1 or 2 makes the diagonal (from top left to bottom right) add up to less than 30, while taking 15 or 16 produces a total greater than 39. Hence 8 must go in the bottom right-hand corner.  

It now follows that * must be replaced by 15, since if 15 is placed in one of the other three vacant squares, we get a total of 45 (second column, too big), 34 (third column, same as diagonal) or 47 (third row, too big).

<!--- (2001) Q24 --->

::: problem id=7_1 marks=3
![](/resources/11-07-colliding-vortexes/7-wire.jpg){image align="right"}
__7.1__ A wire in the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 9 cm is placed on a flat piece of paper.  

A pencil is held in the hole at the centre of a disc of radius 1cm, and the disc is rolled all the way around the outisde of the wire, and then all the way around the inside of the wire.  

What shape is drawn by the pencil?

![](/resources/11-07-colliding-vortexes/7-wire-options.jpg){image align="center"}

* [ ] A
* [ ] B
* [ ] C
* [ ] D
* [x] E
{.col-5}

---

On the outside of the wire, the pencil describes an arc of a circle as the disc rolls around each of the corners of the triangle, but this does not happen when the disc moves around the inside of the wire.

## 8.	1089 and all that

Here’s a trick you can use to impress your friends, as demonstrated by Aisling Bea on BBC’s QI.

@[youtube](FN8cwiDKrkI?rel=0&start=36&end=212) _(If you have problems watching the video, right click to open it in a new window)_

::: problem id=8_1 marks=1
__8.1__ Follow the same procedure in the video, starting with the number 462. What is your answer?

<input solution="1089"/>
:::

::: problem id=8_2 marks=2
__8.2__ Follow the same procedure in the video, starting with the number 464. The trick will not work because the number is a palindrome (i.e., the same backwards). What is your answer when you start with 464?

<input solution="000"/>

Once you have convinced yourself when it will and will not work, you may want to try to prove that it works algebraically. Watch this video of James Grime showing explaining why it works, and make sure you pause and check his algebra at each stage.
