__1.1__ In Britain in 1996 we consumed on average 9.6kg of bananas per person per year (that is, around 60 bananas each). In some parts of Africa, the consumption of bananas is as high as 250kg of bananas per person per year. Roughly how many bananas is that?

* [x] 4 or 5 a day
* [ ] 1 or 2 a day
* [ ] 4 or 5 a week
* [ ] 1 or 2 a week
* [ ] 4 or 5 a month
{.col-3}

---

250 kg is approximately 25 times 9.6 kg. The consumption in some parts of Africa is therefore approximately 25 × 60, ie 1500, per person per year. 4 bananas per day are equivalent to 4 × 365, ie 1460, per year and the best answer is therefore 4 or 5 a day.

__2.1__ A pencil AB lying on a table is given a half-turn about the end B (so that A moves to A') and then a half-turn about A' (so that B moves to B').  

The point C on the pencil is one third of the way from A to B.  

What is the ratio of the total distances moved by A and by C?

* [ ] 3:1
* [ ] 3:2
* [x] 1:1
* [ ] 2:3
* [ ] 1:3
{.col-5}

Let AB be of length 3r. The distance moved by A is then the circumference of a semicircle of radius 3r, ie 3πr. C moves along the circumference of a semicircle of radius 2r, ie 2πr, followed by the circumference of a semicircle of radius r, ie πr. The total distance moved by C is therefore also 3πr.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
