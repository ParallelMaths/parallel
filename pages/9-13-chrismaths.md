It’s nearly Christmas. Not very many people realise that the original name for this holiday was Chrismaths. For centuries, children traditionally completed mathematics problems during the festive period. The amount of effort that children put into their mathematics problems allowed Santa to decide who had been naughty and who had been nice.

With this in mind, this week’s Parallelogram contains a WHOLE maths challenge paper – 25 glorious questions to stretch your brain over Chrismaths.

The time limit on maths challenges is 60 minutes, but it might take you up to 90 minutes to complete all the questions. However, you can tackle the challeges in one, two or three or more sessions. Just complete all the questions and hit the submit button before you go back to school in January. Bear in mind, the last 10 questions are tough. Also, in the real maths challenge paper, there is negative marking for tough questions, which means you lose marks for incorrect answers – don’t worry, in this Parallelogram you will not lose marks for wrong answers.

As this Parallelogram is longer than a typical Parallelogram, you can win a maximum of 400 (rather than 100) rewards points – this is a real opportunity to win an extra badge (or two).

Good luck and happy Chrismaths. Don’t eat too many mince pie charts!

Simon.

Three positive integers are all different. Their sum is 7.  

What is their product?

* [ ] A) 12
* [ ] B) 10
* [ ] C) 9
* [x] D) 8
* [ ] E) 5
{.col-5}

---

It can be seen that 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 and 1 × 2 × 4 = 8, so assuming that there is just one solution, the answer must be 8.

In the context of the IMC, that is enough, but if you are asked to give a full solution, you need to give an argument to show there are no other possibilities. This is not difficult.

For example, suppose `a, b` and `c` are three different positive integers with sum 7, and that `a < b < c`.

If `a ≥ 2`, then `b ≥ 3` and `c ≥ 4`, and so `a + b + c ≥ 9`.

So we must have that `a = 1`. It follows that `b + c = 6`.

If `b ≥ 3` then `c ≥ 4` and hence `b + c ≥ 3 + 4 = 7`. So `b = 2`. Since `a = 1` and `b = 2`, it follows that `c = 4`.

An equilateral triangle, a square and a pentagon all have the same side length.  

The triangle is drawn on and above the top edge of the square and the pentagon is drawn on and below the bottom edge of the square.  

What is the sum of the interior angles of the resulting polygon?

* [ ] A) 10 × 180°
* [ ] B) 9 × 180°
* [ ] C) 8 × 180°
* [ ] D) 7 × 180°
* [x] E) 6 × 180°
{.col-3}

---

The sum of the interior angles of the polygon is the sum of the angles in the triangle, the square and the pentagon. The sum of the interior angles of the triangle is 180°, the sum of the angles of the square is 360° = 2 × 180°, and the sum of the angles of the pentagon is 540° = 3 × 180°.

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/3-shapes-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
So the sum of the angles is (1 + 2 + 3) × 180° = 6 × 180°.  

_Note:_ There is more than one way to see that the sum of the angles of a pentagon is 540°.  

Here is one method. Join the vertices of the pentagon to some point, say `P`, inside the pentagon. This creates 5 triangles whose angles sum to 5 × 180° .The sum of the angles in these triangles is the sum of the angles in a pentagon plus the sum of the angles at `P`, which is 360° = 2 × 180° . So the sum of the angles in the pentagon is 5 × 180° - 2 × 180° = 3 × 180°.

The prime numbers `p` and `q` are the smallest primes that differ by 6.  

What is the sum of `p` and `q`?

* [ ] A) 12
* [ ] B) 14
* [x] C) 16

Suppose `p < q`. Then `q = p + 6`. The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7,….

With `p = 2, q = 8`, which is not prime.

Similarly if `p = 3, q = 9,` which is also not prime.

However, when `p = 5, q = 11`, which is prime.

So, `p = 5`, `q = 11` gives the smallest primes that differ by 6. Then `p + q = 5 + 11 = 16`.

Seb has been challenged to place the numbers 1 to 9 inclusive in the nine regions formed by the Olympic rings so that there is exactly one number in each region and the sum of the numbers in each ring is 11.

We let `u, v, w, x, y` and `z` be the numbers in the regions shown.

Since the sum of the numbers in each ring is 11, we have, from the leftmost ring, that `9 + u = 11` and so `u = 2`. Then, from the next ring, `2 + 5 + v = 11` and so `v = 4`. From the rightmost ring, `z + 8 = 11` and so `z = 3`.  

We have now used the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, leaving 1, 6 and 7.  

From the middle ring we have that `4 + w + x = 11`, and so `w + x = 7`. From the second ring from the right `x + y + 3 = 11`, and so `x + y = 8`.

So we need to solve the equations `w + x = 7` and `x + y = 8`, using 1, 6 and 7.

It is easy to see that the only solution is `x = 1`, `y = 7` and `w = 6`.  

So 6 goes in the region marked * .

Auntie Fi’s dog Itchy has a million fleas. His anti-flea shampoo claims to leave no more than 1% of the original number of fleas after use.

What is the least number of fleas that should be eradicated by the treatment?

Since no more than 1% of the fleas will remain, at least 99% of them will be eradicated.

Now 99% of a million is `99/100 × 1000000 = 99 × 10000 = 990,000`.

## 10.

An ‘abundant’ number is a positive integer `N`, such that the sum of the factors of `N` (excluding `N` itself) is greater than `N`.

What is the smallest abundant number?

* [ ] A) 5
* [ ] B) 6
* [ ] C) 10
* [x] D) 12
* [ ] E) 15
{.col-5}

---

In the IMC, it is only necessary to check the factors of the numbers given as the options.

However, to be sure that the smallest of these which is abundant, is the overall smallest abundant number, we would need to check the factors of all the positive integers in turn, until we find an abundant number.

The following table gives the sum of the factors of `N` (excluding `N` itself), for `1 ≤ N ≤ 12`.

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/10-n-table.jpg){image align="center"}

From this table we see that 12 is the smallest abundant number.

In the diagram, `PQRS` is a parallelogram; `∠QRS = 50°`; `∠SPT = 62°` and `PQ = PT`.

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/11-parallelogram.jpg){image align="center"}

What is the size of `∠TQR`?

* [ ] A) 84°
* [ ] B) 90°
* [x] C) 96°
* [ ] D) 112°
* [ ] E) 124°
{.col-5}

---

Because `PQRS` is a parallelogram, `∠SPQ = ∠QRS = 50°`. Therefore `∠TPQ = (62 + 50)° = 112°`.  

Therefore, as the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, `∠PQT + ∠PTQ = 180° - 1120 = 68°`.

Because `PQ = PT`, the triangle `QPT` is isosceles, and so `∠PQT = ∠PTQ`. Therefore `∠PQT = ∠PTQ = 34°`.  

Because `PQRS` is a parallelogram, `∠PQR + ∠QRS = 180°`, and therefore `∠PQR = 180° - 50° = 130°`.  

Therefore, `∠TQR = ∠PQR - ∠PQT = 130° - 34° = 96°`.

Which of the following has a different value from the others?

* [ ] A) 18% of £30
* [x] B) 12% of £50
* [ ] C) 6% of £90
* [ ] D) 4% of £135
* [ ] E) 2% of £270
{.col-3}

---

We have that 18% of £30 = £`(18/100 × 30)` = £5.40.

Similarly, 12% of £50 is £6.00, and 6% of £90 is £5.40.  

We already see that option B must be the odd one out.

It is easy to check that 4% of £135 and 2% of £270 are also both £5.40.

Alex Erlich and Paneth Farkas shared an opening rally of 2 hours and 12 minutes during their table tennis match at the 1936 World Games. Each player hit around 45 shots per minute.  

Which of the following is closest to the total number of shots played in the rally?

* [ ] A) 200
* [ ] B) 2,000
* [ ] C) 8,000
* [x] D) 12,000
* [ ] E) 20,000
{.col-5}

---

Since they each hit about 45 shots in one minute, between them they hit about 90 shots per minute.  

Now 2 hours and 12 minutes is 132 minutes. So the total number of shots in the match is 90 × 132, and 90 × 132 is approximately 100 × 120 = 12,000 .

What value of `x` makes the mean of the first three numbers in this list equal to the mean of the last four?

* [x] A) 19
* [ ] B) 21
* [ ] C) 24
* [ ] D) 25
* [ ] E) 27
{.col-5}

---

The mean of the first three numbers in the list is `(15 + 5 + x)/3` and the mean of the last four is `(x + 7 + 9 + 17)/4`.  

Now:  
`(15 + 5 + x)/3 = (x + 7 + 9 + 17)/4`  
⇔ `4(15 + 5 + x) = 3(x + 7 + 9 + 17)`  
⇔ `80 + 4x = 3x + 99`  
⇔ `x = 19`.

An alternative method in the context of the IMC would be just to try the given options in turn. This runs the risk of involving a lot of arithmetic, but here, as the first option is the correct answer, the gamble would pay off.

When working out the values of these expressions it is important to remember the convention (sometimes known as BODMAS or BIDMAS) that tells us that Divisions and Multiplications are carried out before Additions and Subtractions.  

Some work can be saved by noting that the expressions A and B have values greater than `1/2`, whereas the value of expression E lies between 0 and `1/2`. So it must be C, D or E that has the value closest to 0.

Now, noting that `1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/3 × 4/1 = 4/3`,  
we obtain that the value of C is `1/2 × 1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/2 × 4/3 = 2/3`;  
that of D is `1/2 - 1/3 ÷ 1/4 = 1/2 - 4/3 = -(5/6)`;  
and that of E is `1/2 - 1/3 × 1/4 = 1/2 - 1/12 = 5/12`.

From these calculations we see that E gives the value closest to 0.

Let `P, Q, R, S, T, U` and `V` be the points shown. All the angles in all the triangles are 60°. So `∠QRT = ∠PSU` and hence `RT` is parallel to `SU`.  

Similarly, as `∠RSV = ∠TUV`, `RS` is parallel to `TU`. Therefore `RSUT` is a parallelogram.  

Therefore `RS` has the same length as `TU`, namely, 2 + 5 = 7 cm. Similarly `PQ` has length 7 cm.

So the length of `PS` which is the sum of the lengths of `PQ`, `QS` and `RS` is 7 + 5 + 7 = 19 cm.

{.col-3}

---

Since the options refer only to the 10th, 13th and 16th terms of the sequence, as far as this IMC question is concerned it is only necessary to check the first 16 terms in the sequence. These are as shown in the table below:

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/17-table-answer.jpg){image align="right"}

From this we see that the 13th term is 13, and the 16th term is 16, and that these are the only cases where the `n` th term is equal to `n`.  

However, a complete answer requires a proof that for all `n` > 16, the nth term is not equal to n. It can be seen that after the 16th term the sequence continues 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1… with the cycle 4, 2, 1 now repeating for ever. It follows that, for `n` ≥ 17, the only values taken by the `n`th term are 8, 4, 2 and 1. We deduce that for `n` ≥ 16, the `n`th term is not equal to `n`.

Suppose that the surrounding circle has radius `r`. In the diagram we have drawn the square with side length `2r` which touches the circle at the points where it meets the arcs.

The square has area `(2r)^2 = 4r^2`. The unshaded area inside the square is made up of four quarter circles with radius `r`, and thus has area `πr^2`. Hence the shaded area is `4r^2  - πr^2 = (4 - π)r^2`.

The circle has area `πr^2`. So the fraction of the circle that is shaded is:

`((4 - π)r^2)/(πr^2) = (4 - π)/π = 4/π - 1`.

Since the side lengths of the rectangle are in the ratio 4:5, they are `4a` cm and `5a` cm, for some positive number `a`.  

This means that the rectangle has area `4a × 5a = 20a^2 cm^2`.

Hence `20a^2 = 125`. So `a^2` = `125/20 = 25/4`, and hence `a = 5/2`.

Hence the rectangle has perimeter `2(4a + 5a) = 18a = 18 × 5/2 = 45` cm.

Let `T` be the foot of the perpendicular from `Q` to the line `SR` extended. Now `RQT` is half of an equilateral triangle with side length 1. Hence the length of `RT` is 1/2 and hence `ST` has length `1 + 1 + 1/2 = 5/2`.

By Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the right angled triangle `RQT, (1)^2 = (1/2)^2 + QT^2`.

Therefore `QT^2 = (1)^2 - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`

Hence, by Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the right angled triangle `SQT, SQ^2 = ST^2 + QT^2 = (5/2)^2 + 3/4 = 25/4 + 3/4 = 7`.

What is the maximum possible value of the median number of cups of coffee bought per
customer on a day when Sundollars Coffee Shop sells 477 cups of coffee to 190 customers,
and every customer buys at least one cup of coffee?

* [ ] A) 1.5

* [ ] D) 3
* [x] E) 3.5
{.col-5}

---

Put the set of numbers of cups of coffee drunk by the individual customers into numerical order with the smallest first. This gives an increasing sequence of positive integers with sum 477. Because 190 is even, the median of these numbers is the mean of the 95th and 96th numbers in this list. Suppose these are `a` and `b`, respectively. Then the median is `1/2(a + b)`.  

We note that `1 ≤ a ≤ b`. Also, each of the first 94 numbers in the list is between `1` and `a`, and each of the last 94 numbers is at least `b`. So if we replace the first 94 numbers by 1, and the last 94 numbers by `b`, we obtain the sequence of numbers

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/22-sequence1.jpg){image align="center"}

whose sum does not exceed 477, the sum of the original sequence. Therefore

![](/resources/9-13-chrismaths/22-sequence2.jpg){image align="center"}

As `1 ≤ a`, it follows that `95 + 95b ≤ 94 + a + 95b ≤ 477`, hence `95b ≤ 477 - 95 = 382` and therefore `b ≤ 382/95`.  

Therefore, since b is an integer, `b ≤ 4`.  

When `b = 4`, it follows from (2) that `94 + a + 380 ≤ 477`, giving `a ≤ 3`.  

This shows that the maximum possible values for a and b are 3 and 4, respectively. We can see that these values are possible, as, if we substitute these values in (1), we obtain a sequence of numbers with sum `94 × 1 + 3 + 95 × 4 = 477`.  

So 3.5 is the maximum possible value of the median.

It follows that `ST = 1/2 PS = 1`. Therefore triangle `RST` is isosceles, and hence `∠STR = ∠SRT`.  

By the Exterior Angle Theorem, `∠PST = ∠STR + ∠SRT`. Therefore `∠STR = ∠SRT = 30°`. Hence `∠QRT = ∠PRQ - ∠SRT = 45° - 30° = 15°`.  

Using the Exterior Angle Theorem again, it follows that `∠STR = ∠TQR + ∠QRT`, and hence `∠TQR = ∠STR - ∠QRT = 45° - 30° = 15°`.  

Therefore the base angles of triangle `TQR` are equal. Hence `TQR` is an isosceles triangle, and so `QT = RT`.  

We also have that the base angles in triangle `TPR` are both equal to 30°, and so `PT = RT`. Therefore `QT = RT = PT`. So `PTQ` is an isosceles right-angled triangle.  

Therefore `∠QPT = 45°`. Finally, we deduce that `∠QPR = ∠QPT + ∠TPS = 45° + 30° = 75°`.

All the positive integers are written in the cells of a square grid.  

Starting from 1, the numbers spiral anticlockwise. The first part of the spiral is shown in the diagram.  

Which number is immediately below 2012?

* [ ] A) 1837
* [ ] B) 2011
* [ ] C) 2013
* [x] D) 2195
* [ ] E) 2210
{.col-5}

The key to the solution is to note that the squares of the odd numbers occur on the diagonal leading downwards and to the right from the cell which contains the number 1, and the squares of the even numbers occur on the diagonal which leads upwards and to the left of the cell which contains the number 4.  

The squares of the even numbers have the form (2n)<sup>2</sup>, that is, 4n<sup>2</sup>. We see that the number 4n<sup>2</sup> + 1 occurs to the left of the cell containing 4n<sup>2</sup>. Below 4n<sup>2</sup> + 1 there occur the numbers 4n<sup>2</sup> + 2, 4n<sup>2</sup> + 3, .., 4n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 1, and then in the cells to the right of the cell containing 4n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 1, there occur the numbers 4n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 2, 4n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 3,..., 4n<sup>2</sup> + 4n + 1 = (2n + 1)<sup>2</sup>.  

Now 44<sup>2</sup> = 1936 and 45<sup>2</sup> = 2025. Thus 2011 is in the same row as 2025 and to the left of it, in the sequence 1981, … ,2012, … ,2025, and below these occur the numbers 2163, … , 2209 = 47<sup>2</sup>, with 2208 below 2025 as shown below.  

It follows that 2195 is the number below 2012.

In the diagram below the square numbers are shown in bold.

The diagram shows a ceramic design by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.  

It is formed by drawing eight lines connecting points which divide the edges of the outer regular octagon into three equal parts, as shown.  

What fraction of the octagon is shaded?

* [ ] A) `1/5`
* [x] B) `2/9`
* [ ] C) `1/4`
* [ ] D) `3/10`
* [ ] E) `5/16`
{.col-5}

We consider the triangular segment of the octagon formed by joining two adjacent vertices, `P` and `Q` to the centre, `O`. For convenience, we show this segment, drawn on a larger scale, on the right, where we have added the lines `RW, ST, TW` and `UV`.  

These lines are parallel to the edges of the triangle `POQ`, as shown and together with the lines `RU` and `SV` they divide the triangle `OPQ` into 9 congruent triangles, of which 2 are shaded.

Thus `2/9` of the segment is shaded. The same holds for all the other congruent segments of the octagon.

So `2/9` of the whole octagon is shaded.
