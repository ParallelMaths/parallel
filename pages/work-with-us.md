# Full-stack web developer, 3-4 hours/week... help us take Parallel to the next level!

Each week, over 5,000 students from around the world log on to Parallel to complete our free maths challenge sheets; a mix of problems, puzzles and videos. Each “parallelogram” is curated by best-selling science writer Simon Singh, and is designed to be challenging, interesting and fun.

We have big plans to expand the Parallel website, with several exciting new features on the horizon.

This expansion will enable us to reach ten times as many students, which will in turn help us to achieve our mission of increasing the number and diversity of excellent mathematicians, who can then build their future in science, technology, engineering or computing.

We are looking for a full-stack web developer who can help us build and maintain the Parallel website, which is currently hosted using Firebase. This is a part-time role that should average around half a day a week, possibly less.

You should be fluent in

* HTML and CSS/SCSS
* JavaScript/TypeScript and NodeJS
* Git/GitHub

and have some experience with

* Firebase or similar hosting platforms
* Wordpress

Parallel is a free website that relies heavily on the goodwill of volunteers, although some remuneration will be offered for the role. If you are an individual or organisation interested in channelling your skills to support the maths development of the next generation, we’d love to hear from you!

In particular, the individual and/or company that helps us to expand the Parallel universe will be credited on the website and their contribution will be highlighted to our students and their parents.
