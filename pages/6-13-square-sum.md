## 1. The square sum problem

Watch this video where famously square person Matt Parker tries to solve this square sum puzzle.

@[youtube](G1m7goLCJDY?start=318&rel=0) _(If you have problems watching the video, right click to open it in a new window)_

You can just watch the video but if you do decide to pause and give Matt’s puzzle a go here are some hints to help you out:

^^^ hint id=1_1_1 marks=0
List the square numbers up to 25 and think of ways you could make them using the numbers 1 to 15.
^^^

^^^ hint id=1_1_1 marks=0
Hint 2: It will not work if you start with Matt’s suggestion of 8, 1, 3, 6, 10.  

Try starting with 8, 1, 15, 10, 6...
^^^

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ Which of these sums does not add to give a square number?

* [x] 1 + 9
* [ ] 1 + 15
* [ ] 2 + 7
* [ ] 30 + 6

---

Square numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself.  

1 + 15 = 16 and `16 = 4 × 4` aka 4<sup>2</sup>.  

The only option on this list which does not have this property is 1 + 9 = 10. 10 is a nice number, but it is not square.
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ Matt’s puzzle only used the numbers 1 to 15, would it have been possible to do with the numbers 1 to 10

* [ ] Yes, it is possible for any amount of numbers
* [ ] No, it only works for the numbers 1 to 15
* [x] No, 15 is the first point where the puzzle starts to work

---

Only once we have the numbers 1 to 15 it is possible to take a path along every point in the graph.  

There are other amounts greater than 15 where the path will work again.
:::

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3__ What is the name of the path which goes through every point on a path?

* [ ] Garden Path
* [x] Hamiltonian Path
* [ ] Washingtonian Path
* [ ] Square Path
:::

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ Is there a path to pass through every corner on a cube without going along the same edge twice?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No
* [ ] It depends on the size of the cube

---

There is a Hamiltonian Path along the edges of a cube.  

In fact there is a Hamiltonian Path along the edges of all of the Platonic Solids!  

The 3D world is a good place to be.
:::

::: problem id=1_5 marks=2
__1.5__ Look at these pairs of numbers. For each pair, square each number and add the results.  

When you do this, which pair gives another square number?

* [ ] 7 and 10
* [x] 3 and 4
* [ ] 3 and 9
* [ ] 1 and 2

## 2. A puzzle adapted from the UKMT challenge

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ I have a list of 6 consecutive numbers, not necessarily starting at 1.  

If the sum of all the even numbers in my list is 24.  

What is the total sum of every number on my list?

* [x] 45
* [ ] 48
* [ ] 50
* [ ] 52
{.col-4}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
If the list contains 6 numbers there must be three even, and three odd numbers.  

The odd numbers could be one more or one less than their even counterparts on the list, consider what happens in each case.
^^^

---

There are two possible solutions to this question.  

Either the list starts on an even number in which case each of the three odd numbers is one more than their even counterpart. The sum of the odd numbers in this case would be 24 + 3.  

This gives a total sum of 24 + 24 + 3 = 51 (which is not an option.

So we know that the list must start on an odd number. In this case each of the odd numbers is one less than its even counterpart on the list.  

Giving an odd total of 24 - 3.  

This gives us an overall list total sum of 24 + 24 - 3 = 45.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
