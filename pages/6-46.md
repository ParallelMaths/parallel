*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.

## 2. Tricky problems

<!--- PMC (2020) Q10 --->
::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
![](/resources/6-46-/2-1-pentagon.png){image align="right"}
__2.1__ The diagram shows a pentagon with a square placed edge to edge with it.  

George places another square on each of the other four edges of the pentagon.  

How many outside edges does the combined shape now have?

* [ ] 13
* [ ] 14
* [x] 15
* [ ] 16
* [ ] 17

---

Each square contributes three edges to the resulting shape, so the polygon will have 3 × 5 = 15 edges.

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2 
__2.2__ A ten foot pole casts an eight foot shadow.  

How long is a pole which casts a twelve foot shadow, in feet?

<input type="number" solution="15"/>  

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1
The height of an object is directly proportional to its shadow, and the proportion is `10/8`.
^^^

---

The height of an object is directly proportional to its shadow, and the proportion is `10/8`.  

So the length of the pole is `10/8 × 12 = 15` feet.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge...  
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	If you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.
*   This was our last Parallelogram of the year, but be sure to come back in September for more puzzles and problems.

Cheerio,
Simon.
