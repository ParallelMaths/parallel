# My Scores

You currently have no scores to view.

## What does your score mean?

Each Parallelogram has its own maximum score, depending on the number and type of questions.
You will then receive a grade ranging from dot (a 0-dimensional object) to line to square to cube to tesseract
(a 4-dimensional object), and the appropriate diagram will appear in your scorecard.

How do you interpret your scorecard?

<table>
<tr>
