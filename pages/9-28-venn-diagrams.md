## 1. Venn diagrams

This is my all time favourite Venn diagram. What? Doesn’t everyone have a favourite Venn Diagram? Anyway... If you don’t yet have a favourite Venn diagram, then you can borrow this one for the time being. Can you work out the label for the two circles? You can find my answer below.

I guess that the left set contains “creatures with flat tails playing guitars”, while the right set contains “creatures with bills playing keyboards”. Hence, the animal in the overlap is a platypus playing a keytar, because it is a creature with a bill AND a flat tail, which is playing a guitar AND a keyboard.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ `ABCDE` is a regular pentagon and `BCF` is an equilateral triangle such that `F` is inside `ABCDE`. What is the size of `∠FAB`?

* [ ] 48°
* [ ] 63°
* [x] 66°
* [ ] 69°
* [ ] 72°
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1
`AB = FB`, so the triangle `ABF` is isosceles, and hence `∠FAB = ∠BFA`.

Since the pentagon `ABCDE` is regular, `BC = AB`. Since the triangle `BCF` is equilateral, `BC = FB`. Therefore, `AB = FB`. So the triangle `ABF` is isosceles, and hence `∠FAB = ∠BFA`.  

`∠ABC = 108°`, as it is the interior angle of a regular pentagon. As the triangle `BCF` is equilateral, `∠FBC = 60°`. Therefore `∠ABF = ∠ABC − ∠FBC = 108° − 60° = 48°`.  

So, from triangle `ABF`, we can deduce that `∠FAB + ∠BFA = 180° − 48° = 132°`.  

Since `∠FAB = ∠BFA`, it follows that `∠FAB = 1/2 (132°) = 66°`.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ The sum:  

`one + four = seventy`  

becomes correct if we replace each word by the number of letters in it to give 3 + 4 = 7.  

Using the same convention, which of these words could be substituted for `x` to make the following sum true?  

`three + five = x`

* [ ] eight
* [ ] nine
* [ ] twelve
* [x] seventeen
* [ ] eighteen
{.col-5}

---

If we replace ‘three’ and ‘five’ by the number of letters in these words, we obtain the equation:  

`5 + 4 = x`.  

Hence `x = 9`. So we need to replace `x` by a word with 9 letters in it. Of the options we are given ‘seventeen’ is the only word with 9 letters in it.

__4.1__ The diagrams show squares placed inside two identical semicircles. In the lower diagram the two squares are identical.  

What is the ratio of the areas of the two shaded regions?

* [ ] 1 : 2
* [ ] 2 : 3
* [ ] 3 : 4
* [x] 4 : 5
* [ ] 5 : 6

Choose units so that the two semicircles have radius 1. We let `x` be the side length of the square in the first diagram, and `y` be the side lengths of the squares in the second diagram.

We choose units so that the two semicircles have radius 1. We let `x` be the side length of the square in the first diagram, and `y` be the side lengths of the squares in the second diagram.

By Pythagoras’ Theorem, we have `x^2 + (1/2 x)^2 = 1` and `y^2 + y^2 = 1`. That is `5/4 x^2 = 1` and `2y^2 = 1`. Therefore `x^2 = 4/5` and `y^2 = 1/2`.  

The shaded region in the top diagram consists of a square of side length `x` and hence of area `x^2`, that is, `4/5`. The shaded region in the lower diagram consists of two squares each of side length `y`, and hence it has area `2y^2`, that is, 1. Hence the ratio of the two shaded regions is `4/5 : 1 = 4 : 5`.

__5.1__ The diagram shows a shaded shape bounded by circular arcs with the same radius. The centres of three arcs are the vertices of an equilateral triangle; the other three centres are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle.  

The sides of the triangle have length 2.  

What is the difference between the area of the shaded shape and the area of the triangle?

* [ ] `π/6`
* [x] `π/4`
* [ ] `π/3`
* [ ] `π/2`
* [ ] `π`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=5
One way to think about this problem is that the difference between the area of the shaded shape and the area of the triangle is:  

* Shaded areas – Triangle area
* (Shaded areas outside Triangle + shaded areas inside Triangle) – Triangle area
* (Shaded areas outside Triangle + [Triangle area – 3 semicircles]) – Triangle area
* Shaded areas outside Triangle + Triangle area – 3 semicircles – Triangle area
* Shaded areas outside Triangle  – 3 semicircles

One way to think about this problem is that the difference between the area of the shaded shape and the area of the triangle is:  

* Shaded areas – Triangle area
* (Shaded areas outside Triangle + shaded areas inside Triangle) – Triangle area
* (Shaded areas outside Triangle + [Triangle area – 3 semicircles]) – Triangle area
* Shaded areas outside Triangle + Triangle area – 3 semicircles – Triangle area
* Shaded areas outside Triangle – 3 semicircles

Since the sides of the triangle have length 2, each of the circular arcs has radius `1/2`. The difference between the area of the shaded shape and that of the triangle, is the difference between the area of the 3 shaded sectors of circles outside the triangle, and that of the 3 unshaded semicircles within the triangle.  

The angles of the equilateral triangle are 60° which is `1/6`th of a complete revolution. So the areas of the shaded sectors of circles outside the triangle are `5/6`ths of the total areas of these circles, each of which has radius `1/2`.  

So the area of these sectors is `3 × (5/6 (π (1/2)^2)) = 5/8 π`. The area of the 3 unshaded semicircles inside the triangle is `3 × (1/2 (π (1/2)^2)) = 3/8 π`. The difference between these is `5/8 π - 3/8 π = 1/4 π`. Hence, the the difference between the area of the shaded shape and the area of the triangle is `π/4`.

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
