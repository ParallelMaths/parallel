## 1. Writing one hundred

Can you write the number one hundred on a piece of paper, but without taking your pen off the paper?  

Have a think about the problem, and perhaps take a lateral approach. That means, instead of taking a headlong run at the problem, think about it from different angles, examine what the question might mean, or what it might not mean. Be creative.  

The answer is in the short video below, but have a hard think before you click play. You really need to come up with some sort of answer, even if it is not brilliant, or even correct.

## 2. Gravitational Waves

One of the greatest scientific discoveries this century was the detection of gravitational waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein at the start of the previous century.  

Take a look at the video below, presented by Professor Kelly Holley-Bockelmann. It is longer than the usual videos we have in Parallel, but it is a brilliant lecture, so it is well worth watching all 18 minutes.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ Which of the following is _not_ the sum of two primes?

* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9
* [x] 11
* [ ] 13
{.col-5}

---

The sum of two odd numbers is even. Therefore, no odd number is the sum of two odd primes. The only even prime is 2. It follows that if any of the odd numbers 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 is the sum of two primes, it is the sum of an odd prime and 2.  

We see that 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 5 + 2, 9 = 7 + 2, 11 = 9 + 2 and 13 = 11 + 2.  

The numbers 3, 5, 7 and 11 are all primes, so each of 5, 7, 9 and 13 is the sum of two primes. However, 9 is not a prime and therefore 11 is not the sum of two primes.  

As we showed above, the only odd prime numbers that are the sum of two primes are those of the form `p` + 2, where `p` is an odd prime. In this case the numbers `p`, `p` + 2 form what is called a twin prime, that is, they are consecutive odd numbers that are both prime. It is an unsolved problem as to whether there are infinitely many twin primes.  

According to the _Goldbach Conjecture_ every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. This has not been proved but, at the time of writing, it has been verified for all even numbers up to `4 × 10^18`. Some partial results are known. For example, Chen’s Theorem (proved by Chen Jingrun in 1973) says that all but a finite number of even numbers can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a number which is either prime or the product of two primes.

__4.1__ Is 63 the sum of two primes?

63 = 61 + 2.
:::

::: problem id=4_2 marks=1
__4.2__ Is 95 the sum of two primes?

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No

---

For the answer to be yes, the two primes would have to be an odd number and an even number. The only even prime is 2, so the odd number would have to be 93, which is not a prime (because 93 = 3 × 31).

__5.1__ The diagram shows a regular octagon.  

What is the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the whole octagon?

* [x] 1 : 4
* [ ] 5 : 16
* [ ] 1 : 3
* [ ] `sqrt(2)` : 2
* [ ] 3 : 8

^^^ hint id=5_1_1 marks=2
We let `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`, `V` and `W` be the vertices of the regular octagon. Let `K`, `L`, `M` and `N` be the points where the diagonals `PS` and `WT` meet the diagonals `QV` and `RU`, as shown in the diagram.  

![](/resources/10-13-gravitation-waves/5-octgaon-answer.jpg){image align="center"}

Because `PQRSTUVW` is a regular octagon, `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT` are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles. We choose units so that the shorter sides of these triangles have length 1.
^^^

^^^ hint id=5_1_2 marks=1
Then, by Pythagoras’ Theorem, the hypotenuse of each of these triangles has length `sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)`. Since the octagon is regular, it follows that each of its sides has length `sqrt(2)`.  

Each of the triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, forms half of a square with side length 1, and so has area `1/2`.

Each of the triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, forms half of a square with side length 1, and so has area `1/2`.  

The shaded trapezium is made up of the two triangles `QKP` and `WNV`, each of area `1/2`, together with the rectangle `KNWP` which has area `sqrt(2) × 1 = sqrt(2)`. Therefore the area of the shaded trapezium is `2 × 1/2 + sqrt(2) = 1 + sqrt(2)`.  

The octagon is made up of the four triangles `QKP`, `WNV`, `SLR` and `UMT`, each with area `1/2`, the four rectangles `KNWP`, `RLKQ`, `MUVN` and `STML`, each with area `sqrt(2)`, and the central square `KLMN` which has area `sqrt(2) × sqrt(2) = 2`. Therefore the area of the octagon is `4 × 1/2 + 4 × sqrt(2) + 2 = 4 + 4 sqrt(2) = 4(1 + sqrt(2))`.  

It follows that the ratio of the area of the shaded trapezium to the area of the octagon is `1 + sqrt(2) : 4(1 + sqrt(2)) = 1 : 4`.

## 6.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- (2016) Q22 --->

::: problem id=6_1 marks=5
__6.1__ In a particular group of people, some always tell the truth, the rest always lie. There are 2016 in the group. One day, the group is sitting in a circle. Each person in the group says, "Both the person on my left and the person on my right are liars."  

What is the difference between the largest and smallest number of people who could be telling the truth?

* [ ] 0
* [ ] 72
* [ ] 126
* [ ] 288
* [x] 336
{.col-5}

---

Each truth teller must be sitting between two liars. Each liar must be sitting next to at least one truth teller and may be sitting between two truth tellers.  

The largest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting between two truth tellers and each truth teller is sitting between two liars. In this case the truth tellers and liars alternate around the table. So half (that is, 1008) of the people are truth tellers and half (1008) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is even.  

The smallest number of truth tellers occurs when each liar is sitting next to just one truth teller and so is sitting between a truth teller and a liar. In this case as you go round the table there is one truth teller, then two liars, then one truth teller, then two liars and so on. So one-third (672) of the people are truth tellers and two-thirds (1374) are liars. This arrangement is possible because 2016 is divisible by 3.  

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of people who could be telling the truth is 1008 − 672 = 336.
