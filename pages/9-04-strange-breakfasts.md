* Make sure you check the solution sheet, celebrate your successes and (most important of all) learn from your mistakes.


## 1. Grandi’s series

Guido Grandi (1671 – 1742) was an Italian monk, philosopher, mathematician and engineer. In 1703-ish, he wondered what happens if you add +1 and −1 over and over again, forever.

1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + 1… = ?{.text-center}

James Grime, a presenter on the terrific Numberphile YouTube channel, explains how you might answer this question. But, before you watch it, spend 30 seconds figuring out what you think the answer might be.

__1.1.__ There is no question associated with this video, but instead I want you to try and explain Grandi’s series to a parent or an older sibling and see if you can explain how a mathematical series can add up to three completely different answers. I am assuming that you will do this. Can I trust you?

## 2. The most important meal of the day

I recently came across this video that shows how there is fascinating science (and therefore mathematics) all around us. Just look closely at what’s staring you in the face and you will see how wonderful and curious the world can be.

If you want to see this for yourself, ask your science teacher to try it out. Your teacher will need a strong magnet (probably neodymium). One of the best cereals to do this with is Kellogg’s Bran Flakes, which contains 11.6mmg of iron per 100g of cereal.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ If you took all the cereal bowls that were on British breakfast tables this morning and tipped them into a Wembley Stadium (before they were eaten), how deep would the pool of cereal be?

You will need to estimate a few things in order to decide the right answer.

* [x] 1 metre
* [ ] 10 metres
* [ ] 50 metres
* [ ] 100 metres
* [ ] 1 kilometre

The key numbers are the volume of a bowl of cereal, the number of bowls of cereal across the country, and the size of Wembley Stadium.  

I reckon that a bowl cereal might be 12cm x 12 cm x 5 cm ≈ 770 cm<sup>3</sup>.  

There are 70 million people in the UK, and maybe 1 in 3 have cereals ≈ 23,000,000 bowls.  

Total volume of cereal ≈ 23,000,000 x 770 cm<sup>3</sup> ≈ 20,000,000,000 cm<sup>3</sup> ≈ 20,000 m<sup>3</sup>.  

The pitch at Wembley, and the space around it is roughly 100 m x 150 m = 15,000 m<sup>2</sup>.  

This means that the pool of cereals in Wembley Stadium would be roughly 1.3m deep.

## 3.	Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem
<!--- (2011) Q4 --->

As I mentioned last week, if you are a Year 9 student, then it likely that you will taking part in the United Kingdom Maths Trust (UKMT) competition known as the Intermediate Maths Challenge (IMC). If you do particularly well, you might earn yourself a gold, silver or bronze certificate, but you will have to work hard as you will be competing against Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11 students from across the country.

Your teachers will help you prepare for this national maths competition, but in each week's Parallelogram we will always include one UKMT Junior Maths Challenge question.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 2:3:5. What is the difference between the largest angle and the smallest angle?

* [ ] 9°
* [ ] 18°
* [ ] 36°
* [ ] 45°
* [x] 54°

---

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Since the angles are in the ratio 2:3:5 we have to divide 180° in the ratio 2:3:5.

The difference between the largest angle the smallest angle is therefore  
`(5 - 2)/(2 + 3 + 5)` `× 180°` = `3/10 × 180°` = `54°`

If you missed the earlier Parallelograms, then try to go back and complete them. After all, you can earn reward points and badges by completing each Parallelogram. Find out more by visiting the Rewards Page … after you have hit the SUBMIT button, gone through the answer sheet and seen your score.

There will be another Parallelogram next week, and the week after, and the week after that. So check your email or return to the website on Thursday at 3pm.

In the meantime, you can find out your score, the answers and go through the answer sheet as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button below.

It is really important that you go through the solution sheet. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something new.

Cheerio,
Simon.
