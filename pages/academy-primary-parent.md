# Parallel Academy (Primary)
## Information for parents


Nominations are now open for a free, exciting online programme for bright and enthusiastic Year 6 maths pupils at state schools in the UK.  

The Parallel Academy has been developed by bestselling science author Simon Singh MBE and Countdown champion Junaid Mubeen, with the goal to increase the number and diversity of excellent young mathematicians. Last year, we supported 600 ambitious primary school pupils across the UK, and this year to hope to increase this over 1,000 students. We are now encouraging teachers to nominate pupils for this year’s primary programme.   

In addition to our [weekly free online maths puzzle sheets](https://parallel.org.uk/), pupils who join the programme will be invited to attend weekly online webinars (our Parallel Circles) that run from January to July. Our webinars are challenging, enjoyable and interactive, with pupils asking questions and providing answers via the chat tab.  

Our primary webinars are a great way to stretch capable pupils in their final year of primary school, but we will also invite pupils to continue with us in Year 7 with another free year of support. In fact, those pupils who demonstrate a particularly strong enthusiasm for maths in Year 7 will be invited to a 5-year programme of online tutorials in secondary school, to guide them towards a STEM degree at a top university. This is a potentially life-changing opportunity.  

We feel this project has huge benefits for pupils, with no disadvantages for parents or schools:  

* Neither parents nor schools pay anything to be involved in this programme.  
* Tutorials and webinars are completed at home, outside of the school day.  
* There is no extra workload for teachers (apart from nominating pupils).  
* We have implemented strong safe-guarding measures, as outlined in [our safeguarding policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhJa7RxgSC5Zv0qtJFXgPjlFFCE4B44F/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=114422519551429202885&rtpof=true&sd=true).  

__There is no cost to the programme, but to be eligible you must be a Year 6 pupil who is currently attending a state school in the UK.__

To take advantage of this opportunity, please send the below link to your child’s maths teacher, and ask them to nominate your child for the Parallel Academy, along with any of their brightest and keenest classmates:

Your child’s teacher should respond by sending parents a link that will allow you to sign up your child - if you don’t hear back from them, be sure to follow up with them.
