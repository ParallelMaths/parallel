*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. The Parker Square

Magic squares have fascinated people throughout history, but Mathematicians still don’t know everything about them!

Watch this video where Matt Parker tries his best at this unsolved Magic Square problem

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ In this magic square the rows, columns and diagonals add to the same magic total.  

Which number should be in the top right?

![](/resources/6-10-parker-square/1-magic-add.png){image align="center"}

<input type="number" solution="5"/>

---

The magic constant is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 so the missing number in the top right is 18 - (10 + 3) = 5

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2__ This is a multiplication magic square, all of the rows, columns and diagonals multiply to the same magic total.

Which number should be in the top middle?

<input type="number" solution="1"/>

---

The magic constant is 216, this is the smallest possible constant for a multiplication magic square.  

18 × 12 = 216 so the missing number must be 1.

::: problem id=1_3 marks=2
__1.3__ There is nothing to stop magic squares including negative numbers.

What is the magic total for this addition magic square?

<input type="number" solution="-9"/>

## 2. Gridlock

::: problem id=2_1 marks=4
![](/resources/6-10-parker-square/2-grid-puzzle.png){image align="right"}
__2.1__ In the multiplication grid shown, the input factors (the ones that would appear in the first row and the first column) are all missing.  

Only some of the products within the table have been given.  

What is the value of A + B + C + D + E?

* [ ] 132
* [ ] 145
* [x] 161
* [ ] 178
* [ ] 193
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=1_2_1 marks=1
In column A we have 15 and 18, what times table includes both of these numbers? This should go at the top of the column.

Now we can figure out row C.
^^^

^^^ hint id=1_2_1 marks=1
In row B we have 15 and 40, they're both in the 5 times table! Put 5 at the start of the row.

Now we can figure out column C.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
