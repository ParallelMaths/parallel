## 1. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2021 (5) --->

::: problem id=1_1 marks=2
__1.1__ April, May and June have 90 sweets between them.  

May has three-quarters of the number of sweets that June has.  

April has two-thirds of the number of sweets that May has.  

How many sweets does June have?  

* [ ] 60
* [ ] 52
* [ ] 48
* [x] 40
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---  

Let `J` be the number of sweets that June has.  

It follows that May has `3/4 J` sweets.  

Hence April has `2/3 (3/4 J)` sweets.  

So April has `(2/3 × 3/4) J = 1/2 J` sweets.  

Because April, May and June have 90 sweets between them: 

`90 = 1/2 J + 3/4 J + J = (1/2 + 3/4 + 1) J = 9/4 J.`  

Thus `9/4 J = 90`  

and we deduce that  `J = 4/9 × 90 = 40`.  

Hence June has 40 sweets.

## 2. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2019 (7) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ How many positive cubes less than 5000 end in the digit 5?  

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1 
The cube root of such numbers would have to end in a 5.
^^^

---

The cube of a positive integer ends in the digit 5 only when the positive integer itself ends in the digit 5.  

So we check the cubes of the positive integers that have units digit 5, until we reach a cube which is greater than 5,000.  

We have `5^3` = 125 < 5,000, `15^3` = 3,375 < 5,000, but `25^3` = 15,625 > 5,000.  

We deduce that there are two positive cubes that end in the digit 5.
:::

::: problem id=2_2 marks=2
__2.2__ What proportion of all the cubes in the range from 1 to 1,000,000 end in the digit 7?

* [ ] `1/7`
* [ ] `1/5`
* [x] `1/10`
* [ ] `1/49`
* [ ] None
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=2_2_1 marks=1 
For a cube number to end in 7, the original number must end in 3.
^^^

---

There are exactly 100 cubes from 1 to 1,000,000: 13, 23 … all the way to 1,003.  

Only the final digit of the number that is cubed determines the final digit of the cubed number.  

The only way for the cubed number to end in 7 is if the number that is cubed ends in 3.  

This is true of one in every ten positive integers, and therefore true of a tenth of the integers from 1 to 100.

## 3. Cheryl’s birthday

Here is a birthday riddle that will put your mind in a spin.  

The problem went viral several years ago because many people couldn’t quite believe the answer.  

When you first see the problem, you too might think there just isn’t enough information, or you may get a different answer altogether.  

This is where logic comes in - by thinking through each step very carefully, we can slowly but surely solve the mysterious case of Cheryl’s birthday.  

Watch the video to see the problem, and the breakdown of the solution - are you convinced?

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1__ What information was Bernard given by Cheryl? 

* [ ] The month of her birthday  
* [x] The day of the month of her birthday
* [ ] The year of her birthday
* [ ] Her age
:::

::: problem id=3_2 marks=2
__3.2__ When Albert says he knows that Bernard doesn’t know Cheryl’s birthday, what information does this give to Bernard?   

* [ ] Cheryl’s birthday is in May 
* [ ] Cheryl’s birthday is in July 
* [x] Cheryl’s birthday is not in May or June
* [ ] It does not reveal any new information

^^^ hint id=3_2_1 marks=1 
Albert can only be sure that Bernard can’t know if the month (which Cheryl revealed to Albert) contains more than one date.
^^^
:::

::: problem id=3_3 marks=2
__3.3__ When Bernard then says he now knows the birthday, what information does this give to Albert?

* [x] Cheryl’s birthday is not on the 14th
* [ ] Cheryl’s birthday is not on the 16th
* [ ] Cheryl’s birthday is in August
* [ ] It does not reveal any new information
:::

::: problem id=3_4 marks=2
__3.4__ How certain can Albert and Bernard be that they know Cheryl’s birthday?

* [ ] Around 90% certain
* [ ] 50% 
* [x] 100% - they have definitely worked it out
* [ ] Albert has a 25% chance of knowing the answer (since there are 4 months and he knows the month) and Bernard has a 16.7% chance (since there are 6 days and he knows the day)

## 4. Intermediate Maths Challenge Problem (UKMT)
<!--- 2020 (18) --->

::: problem id=4_1 marks=3
![](/resources/9-42-cheryls-birthday/4-triangle.jpg){image align="right"}
__4.1__ The diagram shows an isosceles right-angled triangle which has a hypotenuse of length `y`.  

The interior of the triangle is split up into identical squares and congruent isosceles right-angled triangles.  

What is the total shaded area inside the triangle?  

* [ ] `(y^2)/2`
* [ ] `(y^2)/4`
* [x] `(y^2)/8`
* [ ] `(y^2)/16`
* [ ] `(y^2)/32`
{.col-5}

^^^ hint id=4_1_1 marks=1 
By Pythagoras, the other two sides of the triangle have length `y/sqrt(2)`.  

Use this to first calculate the area of the triangle.
^^^

![](/resources/9-42-cheryls-birthday/4-triangle-answer.jpg){image align="right"}
Let the two equal sides of the large right-angled triangle have length `x`.  

By Pythagoras’ Theorem,a pplied to this triangle, we have `x^2 + x^2 = y^2`.  

Therefore `x^2 = (y^2)/2`.  

It follows that the area of the large right-angled triangle is given by:  

`1/2 (base × height) = 1/2 (x × x) = (x^2)/2 = (y^2)/4`.  

The shaded area is made up of four of the small squares.  

The unshaded area is made up of two of the small squares and four half squares, which is the same as the area of four of the small squares.  

Hence the shaded area is equal to the unshaded area.  

Therefore the shaded area is half the area of the large right-angled triangle.  

It follows that the shaded area is given by `1/2 × (y^2)/4 = (y^2)/8`.
