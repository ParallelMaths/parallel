# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 2_ Lou Costello, Pi and More Pendula

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

__Origin__: late 16th century: from French parallélogramme, via late Latin from Greek parallēlogrammon, from parallēlos ‘alongside another’ + grammē ‘line’.  

1. a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.
2. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
   mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
   young mathematicians.

</div>

Welcome to the second of our Parallelograms designed for Year 8 students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain and make your neurons more squiggly.

You can start and stop whenever you like, but you should complete all the challenges by 7pm on Sunday, particularly if your teacher has asked you to complete this Parallelogram.

You can return to the site any time after 7pm on Sunday and you will find your score and a sheet with answers and explanations… as long as you have completed the challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in six parts.


__IMPORTANT__ – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct answer).

__IMPORTANT__ – some questions have a hint (sometimes two hints). Please think hard and try hard before resorting to the hint. The hints will help you get the right answer, but you will lose marks.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Weird film about π

Back in 1998, I went to see a film at the cinema called _π_. To be honest, it was fairly dreadful, so I would not recommend watching the whole film. However, take a look at this snippet form the trailer.

I like the comment that “mathematics is the language of nature”, and you will see that more and more as you study different areas of maths. For example, take a look at this image of the bottom of a pine cone. There are green spirals going clockwise and red spirals going anticlockwise.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ How many green spirals are there?

<input type="number" solution="8"/>  

:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2.__ How many red spirals are there?

<input type="number" solution="13"/>  

:::

These numbers come from a sequence in which you add the previous two numbers to get the next number, e.g, 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 3, then 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377...

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3.__ These series of numbers is called:

* [ ] The triangular sequence
* [ ] The additive series
* [ ] The 112 order
* [x] The Fibonacci sequence
* [ ] The Leibniz series

The sunflower below also has two sets of spirals, and the numbers of spirals are also part of this number series.

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (6)

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ What is the sum of the marked angles in the diagram?
![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/2-triangles.png)

* [ ] 90°
* [ ] 180°
* [ ] 240°
* [ ] 300°
* [x] 360°
{.col-5}

---

The six marked angles are the interior angles of 2 triangles. The interior angles of 1 triangle add up to 180°. So the marked angles add up to 2x180° = 360°.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (7)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. 1 peck = 1/4 bushel and
1 bushel = 1/9 barrel. How many more pecks must Peter Piper pick to fill a barrel?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 34
* [x] 35
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---

We have 1 barrel = 9 bushels and 1 bushel = 4 pecks, and so 1 barrel = 9 x 4 = 36 pecks. Peter Piper has already picked 1 peck, so he needs to pick 35 more pecks to fill a barrel.

## 4. Calculating π with a pendulum

Last week’s Parallelogram looked how the length of a pendulum is linked to the time it takes to swing via a formula involving π. The video below from the brilliant Matt Parker (the Stand-up Mathematician) shows how you can use this formula to work out the value of π. Watch carefully and answer the question below.

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
__4.1__ If it was a perfect experiment, how long should it have taken for 10 swings of the pendulum?

* [ ] 3.128 seconds
* [ ] 3.14 seconds
* [ ] 10.0 seconds
* [ ] 31.28 seconds
* [x] 31.4 seconds

## 5. Infinite expressions for π

Matt’s pi-endulum video starts with something astonishing, namely that there are some beautiful ways of calculating π. (BTW, I use the word ‘beautiful’ because some things in maths are beautiful. They strike your heart and make you go, wow!)

About 350 years ago, mathematicians proved that:

Why on earth should adding every odd fraction and subtracting every even fraction create a quarter of π? When you’re older, might find out, but for now just be gobsmacked.

This equation is very slow, by which I mean that you need to contact a large number of terms before you get an answer that becomes accurate. If you work out the first 300 terms of the formula, then you will eventually work out that π ≈ 3.14. (BTW the squiggly equals sign “≈” means “approximately equal to”.)

In 1748, Leonard Euler proved recipe for calculating  
![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation2.gif)

We can rearrange this to obtain:
![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation3.gif)

Let’s see what happens if use this recipe to calculate π.

| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-1.gif) | π = 2.50 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-2.gif) | π = 2.74 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-3.gif) | π = 2.86 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-4.gif) | π = 2.91 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-5.gif) | π =  |
{.grid}

The result gets closer and closer to the real value of π as we include more and more terms.


::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ What is the value of π accurate when you include the 1/5<sup>2</sup> term?

* [ ] 3.00
* [ ] 2.99
* [ ] 2.98
* [ ] 2.97
* [x] 2.96
:::

Rohit Kumar has created some graphs that show how these two recipes get better and better at approximating π as you include more and more terms. Take a look the graphs below and answer two questions.

![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-2-graphs.png) {alt="From https://www.slideshare.net/rohit_9aug/pi-495638 "}

::: problem id=5_2 marks=1
__5.2__ Which series always underestimate the value of π?

* [ ] Neither of them
* [ ] Both of them
* [ ] The one on the left
* [x] The one on the right
:::

::: problem id=5_3 marks=1
__5.3__ Both series make the biggest improvements in approximating π...

* [x] During the first few terms
* [ ] During the last few terms
* [ ] During the middle few terms
* [ ] When they put in the most effort

## 6. Lou Costello’s masterclass

Last week’s Parallelogram had some disturbing arithmetic courtesy of Ma and Pa Kettle. Here is a similar comedy routine from the great Lou Costello, one of America’s most famous comedians. Watch carefully and see if you can work out why the maths is fundamentally wrong.

@[youtube](MS2aEfbEi7s?start=0m7s)

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1__ If Lou Costello were to work out 3 x 15 or (15 + 15 + 15), what would he think the result is?

  15
  +15
  +15

<input type="number" solution="18"/>

Well done on completing this week’s Parallelogram. Check your email or return to the website on Friday for the next one.

In the meantime, you can find the answers and go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday. This is really important. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something knew.

First …. Remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, so that we can mark your answers.

Also, once you have hit the SUBMIT button there will an extra bit of optional Parallelogram if you are feeling particularly keen.

Cheerio,
Simon.
