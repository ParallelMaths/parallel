<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

__Origin__: late 16th century: from French parallélogramme, via late Latin from Greek parallēlogrammon, from parallēlos ‘alongside another’ + grammē ‘line’.  

1. a four-sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel.
2. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message containing
   mischievous maths problems sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright
   young mathematicians.

</div>

Welcome to the next in our series of our Parallelograms designed for Year 8
students, a collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain
and make your neurons more squiggly.

You can start and stop whenever you like, but you should complete all the
challenges by 7pm on Sunday, particularly if your teacher has asked you to
complete this Parallelogram.

You can return to the site any time after 7pm on Sunday and you will find your
score and a sheet with answers and explanations… as long as you have completed the
challenge and hit the SUBMIT button.

This week’s Parallelogram challenge is in six parts.


__IMPORTANT__ – you will get points for every correct answer (or nearly correct
  answer).

__IMPORTANT__ – some questions have a hint (sometimes two hints). Please think
hard and try hard before resorting to the hint. The hints will help you get the
right answer, but you will lose marks.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when
the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Weird film about π

Back in 1998, I went to see a film at the cinema called _π_. To be honest, it was
fairly dreadful, so I would not recommend watching the whole film. However, take a
look at this snippet from the trailer.

I like the comment that “mathematics is the language of nature”, and you will see
that more and more as you study different areas of maths. For example, take a look
at this image of the bottom of a pine cone. There are green spirals going clockwise
and red spirals going anticlockwise.

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ How many green spirals are there?

<input type="number" solution="8"/>  

:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2.__ How many red spirals are there?

<input type="number" solution="13"/>  

:::

These numbers come from a sequence in which you add the previous two numbers to get
the next number, e.g, 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 3, then 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377...

::: problem id=1_3 marks=1
__1.3.__ This series of numbers is called:

* [ ] The triangular sequence
* [ ] The additive series
* [ ] The 112 order
* [x] The Fibonacci sequence
* [ ] The Leibniz series

:::

The sunflower below also has two sets of spirals, and the numbers of spirals are also part of this number series.

::: problem id=1_4 marks=1
__1.4.__ How many anticlockwise (x) spirals?

<input type="number" solution="34"/>  

:::

::: problem id=1_5 marks=1
__1.5.__ How many clockwise (y) spirals?

<input type="number" solution="21"/>

## 2. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (6)

The Junior Maths Challenge is a national maths competition run by the UK Maths
Trust, and many of you may have entered last year and might be entering this year.
Ask your teacher, and he or she will know whether you or your class will be
entering.  

The Junior Maths Challenge is aimed at confident young mathematicians who want to
stretch their brains with questions that are bit spicier than those you might
encounter in the classroom. Each week, the Parallelograms will contain one or two
Challenge questions from the tests given in previous years.

These will be good practice if you are entering this year, and even if you are not
entering they will still be good ways to stretch your mathematical mind. To get
you warmed up, here is a relatively easy question... followed by another one that
most of you should be able to attack.

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1.__ What is the sum of the marked angles in the diagram?
![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/2-triangles.png)

* [ ] 90°
* [ ] 180°
* [ ] 240°
* [ ] 300°
* [x] 360°
{.col-5}

---

The six marked angles are the interior angles of 2 triangles. The interior angles of 1 triangle add up to 180°. So the marked angles add up to 2x180° = 360°.

## 3. Junior Maths Challenge 2011 (7)

::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
__3.1.__  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. 1 peck = 1/4 bushel and
1 bushel = 1/9 barrel. How many more pecks must Peter Piper pick to fill a barrel?

* [ ] 12
* [ ] 13
* [ ] 34
* [x] 35
* [ ] 36
{.col-5}

---

We have 1 barrel = 9 bushels and 1 bushel = 4 pecks, and so 1 barrel = 9 × 4 = 36 pecks. Peter Piper has already picked 1 peck, so he needs to pick 35 more pecks to fill a barrel.

## 4. Calculating π with a pendulum

Last week’s Parallelogram looked how the length of a pendulum is linked to the time
it takes to swing via a formula involving π. The video below from the brilliant Matt
Parker (the Stand-up Mathematician) shows how you can use this formula to work out
the value of π. Watch carefully and answer the question below.

@[youtube](qYAdXm69l8g?end=220&rel=0)

::: problem id=4_1 marks=1
__4.1__ How long did it take in Matt’s experiment for 1 swing?

* [ ] 3.1 seconds
* [x] 3.128 seconds
* [ ] 3.141 seconds
* [ ] 31.28 seconds
* [ ] 31.4 seconds
:::

::: problem id=4_2 marks=2
__4.2__ If it was a perfect experiment, how long should it have taken for 10 swings of the pendulum?

* [ ] 3.128 seconds
* [ ] 3.14 seconds
* [ ] 10.0 seconds
* [ ] 31.28 seconds
* [x] 31.4 seconds

---

Matt’s experiment was imperfect (in fact all experiments are imperfect), so the
answer to question 4.1 and Matt’s result in the video was 3.128 seconds. However,
if it was a perfect experiment, then each swing would have been π seconds long, or
3.14 seconds. So 10 swings would have been 31.4 seconds, and that is the answer.

## 5. Infinite expressions for π

Matt’s pi-endulum video starts with something astonishing, namely that there are
some beautiful ways of calculating π. (BTW, I use the word ‘beautiful’ because some
things in maths are beautiful. They strike your heart and make you go, wow!)

About 350 years ago, mathematicians proved that:  
![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation1.gif)

Why on earth should adding half the odd fractions and subtracting the other half
of odd fractions and multiplying by 4 be equal to π? When you’re older, you might
find out, but for now just be gobsmacked.

This equation is very slow, by which I mean that you need to take into account a
large number of terms before you get an answer that becomes accurate. If you work
out the first 300 terms of the formula, then you will eventually work out that
π ≈ 3.14. (BTW the squiggly equals sign “≈” means “approximately equal to”.)

In 1748, Leonard Euler proved this recipe for calculating π  

![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation2.gif)

We can rearrange this to obtain:  

![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation3.gif)

Let’s see what happens if we use this recipe to calculate π, using just one term,
then two terms, then three, four and five terms.

| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-1.gif) | π = 2.45 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-2.gif) | π = 2.74 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-3.gif) | π = 2.86 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-4.gif) | π = 2.92 |
| ![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-equation4-5.gif) | π =  |
{.grid}

The result gets closer and closer to the real value of π as we include more and more terms.


::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1__ What is the value of π when you include the 1/5<sup>2</sup> term?

* [ ] 3.00
* [ ] 2.99
* [ ] 2.98
* [ ] 2.97
* [x] 2.96
:::

Rohit Kumar has created some graphs that show how these two recipes get better and
better at approximating π as you include more and more terms. Take a look the graphs
below and answer two questions.

![](/resources/8-02-lou-costello/5-2-graphs.png) {img alt="From https://www.slideshare.net/rohit_9aug/pi-495638 "}

::: problem id=5_2 marks=1
__5.2__ Which series always underestimate the value of π?

* [ ] Neither of them
* [ ] Both of them
* [ ] The one on the left
* [x] The one on the right

---

Because the series on left has positive and negative terms (addition and
subtraction), then it keeps jumping above the value of π, and then below it, and
then above it, and then below it, and so on. By contrast, the series on the right
only has positive terms, so it starts at a very low value and gradually approaches
the true value from below. Therefore the series on the right always underestimates
the true value of π.
:::

::: problem id=5_3 marks=1
__5.3__ Both series make the biggest improvements in approximating π...

* [x] During the first few terms
* [ ] During the last few terms
* [ ] During the middle few terms
* [ ] When they put in the most effort

---
Initially, both series are wildly inaccurate, but within the first 25 terms they
both begin to home in on the true value of π. Thereafter the curve is almost flat,
suggesting that there are only minor improvements in getting close to π. Hence,
the biggest improvements take place during the first few terms.

## 6. Lou Costello’s masterclass

Last week’s Parallelogram had some disturbing arithmetic courtesy of Ma and Pa Kettle. Here is a similar comedy routine from the great Lou Costello, one of America’s most famous comedians. Watch carefully and see if you can work out why the maths is fundamentally wrong.

@[youtube](MS2aEfbEi7s?start=7&rel=0)

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1__ If Lou Costello were to work out 3 × 15 or (15 + 15 + 15), what would he think the result is?
