# Pi = 3.2?

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteau word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

*	Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
*	Finish by midnight on Sunday if your whole class is doing parallelograms.
*	Your score & answer sheet will appear immediately after you hit SUBMIT.
*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1. How big is a slice of Pi?

We all love pi, but it has a lot of digits!  

Wouldn’t life be simpler if we just rounded it a little? Made it a bit more bite size?  

Watch this video about the narrowly averted disaster, when pi almost officially became 3.2.  

Luckily there was a mathematician passing by!

::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1__ Which state almost mistakenly legislated that pi was in fact equal to 3.2?

* [ ] Alaska
* [x] Indiana
* [ ] Washington
* [ ] New York

::: problem id=1_2 marks=1
__1.2__ Which classical problem was Edward Goodwin attempting to solve?

* [x] Squaring the Circle
* [ ] Proof of the RiemannReimann Hypothesis
* [ ] The Mutilated Chess Board Problem
* [ ] The Seven Bridges of Konnigsberg

__1.3__ Which of these numbers, when rounded to 1 decimal place, would give 3.2?

* [ ] 3.94

::: problem id=1_4 marks=2
__1.4__ It may not be possible to construct a square with the same area as a circle, but can you find a square with the same area as this triangle?  

What would its edge length be?

## 2. Triangle tangle puzzle

::: problem id=2_1 marks=3
__2.1__ Six identical right-angled triangles fit inside a rectangle as shown in the diagram.  

The rectangle measures 24cm by 29cm.  

What is the total shaded area in cm<sup>2</sup>?

![](/resources/6-20-pi/2-triangle-puzzle.png){image align="center"}

* [x] 180 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 348 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 30 cm<sup>2</sup>
* [ ] 72 cm<sup>2</sup>
{.col-4}

^^^ hint id=2_1_1 marks=1
It looks like the rectangle has the same height as two of the triangles.  

Can you find the height of the triangles by splitting up the shorter length of 24?

^^^

^^^ hint id=2_1_2 marks=1
It looks like the longer length of the rectangle is made of two long triangle sides (which we just found) and a bit left over.   

Can we use this to find the shorter side of the triangle?

^^^ hint id=2_1_3 marks=1
Now knowing that the area of a triangle can be calculated by using 1/2 × base × height.  

Find the total area for __all__ 6 triangles.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon and Ayliean.
