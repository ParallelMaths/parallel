<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

Here is this week's collection of mathematical challenges designed to stretch your brain.  

*	Start and stop whenever you like – your work will be saved each time.
*	But it is better to tackle each Parallelogram in one go.
* Complete by 7pm Sunday if your whole class is doing Parallelograms.
*	Return after 7pm on Sunday to find your score, answers and explanations.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, the main thing is
that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong
when the answer sheet appears.

## 5. Junior Maths Challenge bonus (2013)

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
__5.1.__ What is the value of `( (1 - 1) - 1) - (1 - (1 - 1))`?

* [x] -2
* [ ] +1
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
{.col-5}

We have `( (1 - 1) - 1) - (1 - (1 - 1)) = (0 - 1) - (1 - 0) = -2`

## 6. The North Pole riddle – the genius version

This video is titled “Elon Musk’s favorite interview question”, and it is explores in great depth a question that we have covered in two recent Parallelograms. By the way, if you have not heard of Elon Musk, he studied physics at university and he is now labelled the real life Iron Man because he has built a business empire based on developing incredible technology – everything from batteries to rockets. In fact, the second video shows Elon Musk in a cameo in the “Iron Man 2” movie.

::: problem id=6_1 marks=2
__6.1.__ You are standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk 1 km south, 1 km west and 1 km north, and you end up exactly where you started. According to  Musk’s full answer, which of the following is most accurate?

* [ ] You are near the South Pole.
* [x] You can be near either North or South Poles.
* [ ] You are on the Equator.

Check your email or return to the website on Friday at 4pm for the next Parallelogram.

In the meantime, you can go through the answer sheet after 7pm on Sunday, but first remember to hit the SUBMIT button below, and then maybe take a look at the “Additional Stuff” section.

Cheerio,
Simon.

## Additional Stuff

* [This article – The real-life Iron Man](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/09/elon-musk-the-real-life-iron-man){target="_blank"} – will tell you a bit more about Elon Musk.

* Today’s first question was based on something I saw on the [www.mathforlove.com](www.mathforlove.com){target="_blank"} website, which (as the name suggests) has lots of great stuff for people who love math…ematics. For example, [this is a whole worksheet about the billiard ball problem](https://mathforlove.com/lesson/billiard-ball-problem/){target="_blank"}. It is quite a project and it is written as if the reader is a teacher preparing something for students, but it will also make sense if you are a student.

* Teachers and parents (and maybe students) might also be interested in this short TEDx talk by Dan Finkel who started the website, in which he explains the best ways to develop a love of maths and some concrete skills – “Five Principles of Extraordinary Math Teaching”
