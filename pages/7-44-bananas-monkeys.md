*	Don’t worry if you score less than 50%, because it means you will learn something new when you __check the solutions__.


## 1.
<!--- 2007 (1) --->
::: problem id=1_1 marks=1
__1.1.__ What is the value of `0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 × 0.4`?

* [ ] 0.24
* [ ] 0.312
* [x] 0.42
* [ ] 1.0
* [ ] 1.5
{.col-5}

---
`0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 × 0.4 = 0.3 + 0.12 = 0.42`.

## 2.
<!--- 2007 (3) --->

::: problem id=2_1 marks=2
__2.1__ What is the remainder when 354972 is divided by 7?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
{.col-5}

---
Note that 7 divides 35, 49 and 7, so it divides 354970. So the remainder is 2.

## 3. Bananas

Here is a tweet that caught my eye:

_It turns out a major new study recently found that humans eat more bananas than monkeys._  

_I can't remember the last time I ate a monkey._  

_(from Charina91)_

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ How many bananas do humans eat each year?  

* [ ] 100 thousand
* [ ] 100 million
* [x] 100 billion
* [ ] 100 trillion
{.col-5}

## 4.
<!--- 2007 (10) --->
::: problem id=4_1 marks=4
__4.1.__ Which of the following has the largest value?

* [ ] `1/2` + `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2` - `1/4`
* [ ] `1/2` × `1/4`
* [x] `1/2` ÷ `1/4`
* [ ] `1/4` ÷ `1/2`
{.col-5}

---

The values of the five expressions are:

* `1/2` + `1/4` = `3/4`
* `1/2` - `1/4` = `1/4`
* `1/2` × `1/4` = `1/8`
* `1/2` ÷ `1/4` = `2`
* `1/4` ÷ `1/2` = `1/2`

So `1/2` ÷ `1/4` has the largest value.

## 5.
<!--- 2007 (12) --->
::: problem id=5_1 marks=5
![](/resources/7-44-bananas-monkeys/21-sculpture-question.gif){image align="right"}
__5.1.__ The sculpture ‘Cubo Vazado’ [Emptied Cube] by the Brazilian artist Franz Weissmann is formed by removing cubical blocks from a solid cube to leave the symmetrical shape shown.

If all the edges have length 1, 2 or 3, what is the volume of the sculpture?

* [ ] 9
* [ ] 11
* [x] 12
* [ ] 14
* [ ] 18
{.col-5}

---

Consider the sculpture to consist of three layers, each of height 1. Then the volumes of the bottom, middle and top layers are 5, 2, 5 respectively. So the volume of the sculpture is 12.

Alternatively: the sculpture consists of a `3 × 3 × 3` cube from which two `2 × 2 × 2` cubes have been removed. The `2 × 2 × 2` cubes have exactly one `1 × 1 × 1` cube (the cube at the centre of the `3 × 3 × 3` cube) in common. So the volume of the sculpture `= 27 − (2 × 8 - 1) = 12`.

Before you hit the SUBMIT button, here are some quick reminders:

*	You will receive your score immediately, and collect your reward points.
*	You might earn a new badge... if not, then maybe next week.
*	Make sure you go through the solution sheet – it is massively important.
*	A score of less than 50% is ok – it means you can learn lots from your mistakes.
*	The next Parallelogram is next week, at 3pm on Thursday.
*	Finally, if you missed any earlier Parallelograms, make sure you go back and complete them. You can still earn reward points and badges by completing missed Parallelograms.

Cheerio,
Simon.
