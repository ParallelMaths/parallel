# _Year 8 • Parallelogram 3_ Surfing Chaos

<div class="dictionary">

__Noun__: Parallelogram
__Pronunciation__: /ˌparəˈlɛləɡram/

1. a portmanteaux word combining parallel and telegram. A message sent each
week by the Parallel Project to bright young mathematicians.

</div>

* Tackle each Parallelogram in one go. Don’t get distracted.
* When you finish, then remember to hit the SUBMIT button.
* Finish by Sunday night if you’re taking part with your classmates.
* Extra reward points for Parallelograms finished by Monday.

__IMPORTANT__ – it does not really matter what score you get, because the main thing is that you think hard about the problems... and then learn where you went wrong when the answer sheet appears.


## 1. Kaprekar numbers
![](/resources/8-03-surfing-chaos/D._R._Kaprekar.gif){image align="right"}
In the previous two Parallelograms we looked at discovered made by D.R. Kaprekar, an Indian mathematics teacher who was born in 1905.

By the way, if you missed them, go back and complete Parallelograms 1 and 2, as it is never too late to pick up reward points and start earning badges.

This week, we’re going to look at something called a Kaprekar number, which Wikipedia defines as:

_“a positive integer with the property that if it is squared, then its representation can be partitioned [or split] into two positive integer parts whose sum is equal to the original number (e.g. 45, since 45<sup>2</sup> = 2025, and 20 + 25 = 45”._

Another example is 9, because 9<sup>2</sup>= 81, and 8 + 1 = 9.


::: problem id=1_1 marks=3
__1.1.__ There is a Kaprekar number between 700 and 710. Which number?

<input type="text" solution="703"/>  

---

703, because 703<sup>2</sup> = 494,209, and 494 + 209 = 703.
:::

::: problem id=1_2 marks=2
__1.2.__ All the numbers in this sequence are Kaprekar numbers:

9, 	99,  999,  9,999…

When you square each of these numbers, you can then partition or split them into two numbers before adding them to make the original number. When you do this, the value of the smaller number is always….

* [x] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 7
* [ ] 9

1 - For example, 909<sup>2</sup>= 998,001, and 998 + 001 = 999.

## 2. You can’t script this

Last week’s Parallelogram included a brief look at mathematical chaos via a clip from Jurassic Park, but I did not really define chaos. One definition is: “Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.”

Usually, if two systems start off in ALMOST the same way, then a while later they will evolve into two systems that are quite similar to each other. If one 5-year-old child is 1 cm taller than another 5-year-old child, then ten years late one 15-year old child might be, say, 5cm taller than the other one.

By contrast, in a chaotic system, tens years later one child has grown taller, while the other child has transformed into microscopic octopus. That is not a technical definition of mathematical chaos, but it might give you some idea of what it means.

This video takes another look at chaos. It is called “You can’t script this”, because you can’t predict what will happen with a chaotic system. You can’t write the story, because the most miniscule change in how the story starts might completely change how the story ends.

## 3.	UKMT Problem

As I mentioned last week, if you are a Year 8 student, then it is likely that you will be taking part in the United Kingdom Maths Trust (UKMT) competition known as the Junior Maths Challenge (JMC). If you do particularly well, you might earn yourself a gold, silver or bronze certificate, but you will have to work hard as you will be competing against students from across the country.

Your teachers will help you prepare for this national maths competition, but each week in Parallelogram we will always include one UKMT Junior Maths Challenge question.

::: problem id=3_1 marks=3
__3.1__ What is the value of ((1−1) −1) − ((1− (1−1))?

* [x] −2
* [ ] −1
* [ ] 0
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2

---

We have ((1−1) −1) − ((1− (1−1)) = (0 −1) − (1− 0) = (−1) − (1) = −2.

***

If you missed the first two Parallelograms, then try to go back and complete them. After all, you can earn reward points and badges by completing each Parallelogram. Find out more by visiting the Rewards Page after you hit the SUBMIT button.

There will be another Parallelogram next week, and the week after, and the week after that. So check your email or return to the website on Thursday at 4pm.

In the meantime, you can find out your score, the answers and go through the answer sheet as soon as you hit the SUBMIT button below.

It is really important that you go through the solution sheet. Seriously important. What you got right is much less important that what you got wrong, because where you went wrong provides you with an opportunity to learn something new.

Cheerio,
Simon.
