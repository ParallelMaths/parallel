    p #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh") Dr Simon Singh], author of the No. 1 bestseller #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_(book)" target="_blank") Fermat’s Last Theorem] and #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_and_Their_Mathematical_Secrets" target="_blank") The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets], has created a set of weekly maths challenges – 60 minutes of interesting, fun and challenging material that goes beyond school maths: mystery and history, activities and oddities, puzzles and problems. So far, we have four sets of challenges designed for students aged 11 to 13, but if you like what we do then there will be more challenges later in the year.

    p The Parallel Project was devised as an add-on for the #[a(href="/about#top-top-set") Top-Top Set Project] and is supported by #[a(href="/about#good-thinking") Good Thinking]. It’s #[strong FREE] to sign up and all the materials we offer are also #[strong FREE].
