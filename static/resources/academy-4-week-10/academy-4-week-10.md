# Euclid Module 4 Week 9 Homework

These homework problems relate to a recent theme you have been covering with your tutor. They are arranged in order of increasing difficulty and the final problem is much more of a challenge than the rest.  

The problems are designed to help you reflect on material from previous tutorial sessions (which you can access on your Academy page).  

Each part of the first question is worth 1 mark and every question after this is worth 2 marks. Some have an optional hint, which cost 1 mark, so only reveal the hint if you’ve given the problem some real thought.   

Take your time, ensuring that you haven't overlooked something or made a silly error, before submitting your answers. Please remember that completing homework is certainly not a race!  

You should only leave an answer blank if you have really thought about the problem and are still stuck (particularly with the final problem).  

We will also be running a weekly drop-in homework help tutorial (look out for our emails).  


## 1.
The following five questions relate to the diagram below, which consists of three straight lines and eight angles.

In each of the five different cases below, decide if:  

`L_1` and `L_2` must be parallel – type _p_ in the relevant answer box  

`L_1` and `L_2` must not be parallel – type _x_ in the relevant answer box  

We cannot tell if `L_1` and `L_2` are parallel – type _m_ in the relevant answer box

<input type="number" solution="x"/>

The lines `L_1` and `L_2` must be parallel because Angle `3` and Angle `5` are equal alternate angles.  

The lines `L_1` and `L_2` are not parallel because Angle `4` and Angle `8` are corresponding angles which are not equal.  

The lines `L_1` and `L_2` must be parallel because Angle `4` and Angle `5` are co-interior angles which sum to `180°`.  

We cannot tell if `L_1` and `L_2` are parallel as Angle `5` and Angle `7` must always be equal as they are vertically opposite angles.  

Angle `2` equals Angle `4` as they are vertically opposite angles. This means that `L_1` and `L_2` are not parallel because Angle `4` and Angle `5` are co-interior angles which do not sum to 180°.

Below is a short geometrical proof of the parallel lines angle fact 'Alternate angles are equal'.  

![](/resources/academy-4-week-9/2-qdiagram.png){image align="center"}  

`∠BAE = ∠CED` (Corresponding angles are equal)  

`? = ∠CED` (Vertically opposite angles are equal)  

`? = ∠BAE` (substitution from previous equality)  

Therefore, the alternate angles ? and ∠𝐵𝐴𝐸 are equal.  

Which of the following angles should replace the question mark?  

* [ ] `∠FAE`
* [ ] `∠AEC`
* [ ] `∠DEF`
* [ ] `∠AEC`
* [x] `∠FEA`
{.col-5}

---

The only angle among the options which is vertically opposite `∠CED` is `∠FEA`.

## 3.
::: problem id=3_1 marks=2
With your tutor you will have discussed that the value of `x` in the diagram below is `180°  -  90° = 87°`, as there is a co-interior pair of angles which must sum to `180°`.  
 
![](/resources/academy-4-week-9/3-qdiagram.png){image align="centre"}  

Is `ABC` a straight line? Choose from the options given below.  

* [ ] Yes, as `∠ABE + ∠BEA + ∠EAB = 180°`
* [ ] Yes, as `∠DAC + ∠ACD + ∠CDA = 180°`
* [ ] Yes, as `∠ABE + ∠EBC = 180°`
* [ ] No, as `∠ABE + ∠EBC < 180°`
* [x] No, as `∠ABE` is not equal to `∠ACD`

^^^ hint id=3_1_1 marks=1
Use Triangle `ABE` to calculate `∠ABE`. Next, think carefully about the parallel angle facts that you know.  
^^^

---

We have that `∠ABE = 180°  −  32°  −  49° = 99°`, and so it is not equal to `∠ACD`.  

This means that these two angles do not form a pair of equal corresponding angles and so `ABC` is not a straight line.  

(Alternatively, we can see that `∠ABE = 99°` also implies that `∠ABE + ∠EBC > 180°` and so `ABC` is not a straight line.)

In the diagram below, Triangle `QRS` is an isosceles right-angled triangle with `QR = SR` and `∠QRS = 90°`.    

Line segment `PT` intersects `SQ` at `U` and `SR` at `V`.

If `∠PUQ = ∠RVT = 𝑦°`, find the value of `2𝑦`.  
  
[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]

<input type="number" solution="135"/>

^^^ hint id=4_1_1 marks=1
Start by finding the values of `∠RQS` and `∠RSQ`. Next, try to find values or expressions for the remaining angles in Triangle `SVU`.  
^^^

---
`∠RQS = ∠RSQ = 45°`  (Triangle `QRS` is an isosceles right-angled triangle with `QR = SR`)  

`∠SUV = ∠PUQ = 𝑦°` and `∠SVU = ∠RVT = 𝑦°` (vertically opposite angles are equal)  

`∠VSU + ∠SUV + ∠SVU = 45° + 𝑦° + 𝑦° = 180°` (interior angles of Triangle `SVU` sum to `180°`)  

Simplifying (and ignoring units) gives `2𝑦 = 135`.

::: problem id=5_1 marks=2
Find the value, in degrees, of angle `x` in the diagram on the below.  

[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]

<input type="number" solution="50"/>

^^^ hint id=5_1_1 marks=1
Think about Triangle `ABC`, what type of triangle is it?  
^^^

---
![](/resources/academy-4-week-9/5-sdiagram.png){image align="right"}
From the diagram we know that `BE = AD` and `AE = CD`.  

`AC = AD + CD = BE + AE = AB` so Triangle `ABC` is isosceles.  

`∠ACB = ∠CBA = 80°` (Triangle `ABC` is isosceles)  

`∠BAC = 180°  −  ∠CBA  −  ∠ACB = 180°  −  80°  −  80° = 20°` (interior angles of Triangle `ABC` sum to `180°`)  

`∠DEA = 180°  −  ∠ADE  −  ∠EAD = 180°  −  30°  −  20° = 130°` (interior angles of Triangle `AED` sum to `180°`)  

`x° = 180° = ∠DEA = 180°  −  130° = 50°` (angles on a straight line sum to `180°`)  

Finally, we have that `x = 50`.

In the diagram to the right, `A, B, D, F` and `G` lie on a vertical line, Triangle `BCD` is right-angled at `C`, and Triangle `DEF` is right-angled at `E`.  

Also, `∠ABC = x°, ∠CDE = 80°` and `∠EFG = 𝑦°`.  
 
What is the value of `x + y`?  

[No degree symbol is necessary in your answer.]  

<input type="number" solution="280"/>  

^^^ hint id=6_1_1 marks=1
You cannot calculate the value of `x` or `y` on their own, but you can come up with a value for their sum `x + y`.  
 
Try to write other angles in the diagram in terms of `x` and `y`.  
^^^

--- 
`∠CBD = 180°  −  x°` (angles on a straight line sum to `180°`)  

`∠BDC = 180°  −  (180°  −  x°)  −  90° = x°  −  90°` (interior angles of Triangle `BCD` sum to `180°`)  

By an almost identical argument to the above, it must be that `∠EDF = y°  −  90°`.  

`∠BDC + ∠CDE + ∠EDF = (x°  −  90°) + 80° + (𝑦  −  90°) = 180°` (angles on a straight line sum to `180°`)  

Simplifying (and ignoring units) gives `x + y  -  100 = 180`.  

Finally, we have that `x + y = 280`.
