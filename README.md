# Parallel

_Parallel_ is a weekly bulletin written by Simon Singh, author of No.1 bestseller Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem.

Every week, participating students will receive an email that contains 60 minutes of interesting, fun and challenging maths that goes beyond school maths: mystery and history, activities and oddities, puzzles and problems.


## Getting started

This repo contains a static website that hosts the content of each week's
parallelogram. Using Firebase, students can create accounts, save their
progress and see their scores.

**Firstly clone the repository and enter the directory**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ParallelMaths/parallel.git
cd parallel
```

**Next you need to setup your service account information**
```bash
mkdir private
touch private/service-account.json # put your service account json in here
```

**Then you can install the node dependancies using our version of Node**
```bash
nvm use # If you dont have nvm it can be installed here https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
npm install
```

**Finally you can start the app locally**
```bash
npm start
```

**You can access the local server on http://localhost:5000**

## Deployments

To deploy updates to the [live site](https://parallel.org.uk), use
`npm run deploy`. (This requires access to the linked Firebase account.)


## Adding a new Parallelogram

Adding a new parallelogram consists of three parts:

* Create a new file at `/pages/<name>.md` with the parallelogram content.
* Upload all required resources (e.g. images) to `/static/resources/<name>/`.
* Update `/pages/pages.yaml` with the new parallelogram and the required timings.
