# Parallel

_Parallel_ is a weekly bulletin written by [Dr Simon Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh), author of No.1 bestseller Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem.

Every week, participating students will receive an email that contains 60 minutes of interesting, fun and challenging maths that goes beyond school maths: mystery and history, activities and oddities, puzzles and problems.

Parallel is designed for students in Year 7 and Year 8, and the pilot will run for four weeks, starting on June 30.


## Run locally

This repo contains all the content of Parallel, and a static website that allows students to register and save their progress.

To run the server locally, you need `npm`. Install all dependencies using `npm install`, and then start the server on port 8086 by running `npm start`.
