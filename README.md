# Parallel

_Parallel_ is a weekly bulletin written by Simon Singh, author of No.1 bestseller Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem.

Every week, participating students will receive an email that contains 60 minutes of interesting, fun and challenging maths that goes beyond school maths: mystery and history, activities and oddities, puzzles and problems.

Parallel is designed for students in Year 7 and Year 8, and the pilot will run for four weeks, starting on June 30.


## Getting started

This repo contains a static website that hosts the content of each week's
parallelogram. Using Firebase, students can create accounts, save their
progress and see their scores.

To run the server locally, you need `npm`. Install all dependencies using
`npm install`, and then start the server on port 5000 by running `npm start`.

To deploy updates to the [live site](https://parallel.org.uk), use
`npm run deploy`. (This requires access to the linked Firebase account.)


## Adding a new Parallelogram

Adding a new parallelogram consists of three parts:

* Create a new file at `/pages/<name>.md` with the parallelogram content.
* Upload all required resources (e.g. images) to `/resources/<name>/`. Note that
  the names of the `.md` file and the resources directory have to match.
* Update `/pages/pages.yaml` with the new parallelogram and the required timings.
